To demonstrate that it's not just a man's world, the nonpartisan Women's Foreign Policy Council has produced the first section of a planned national directory of women who are ''authorities on every phase of foreign and military policy.'' One goal of the year-old council is ''to help make American women more visible and credible as formulators and discussants of foreign policy issues.'' The five-page directory segment, distributed to the press, contains names, addresses, telephone numbers and brief statements of qualification for 11 experts on the Near East and two each on covert action and counterintelligence, human rights and terrorism, Nicaragua and general foreign policy and national security issues. The council plans to publish the full directory next year. Among those listed in the first installment are Patricia Derian, former Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights; Rita Hauser, a New York lawyer who was a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly; Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and Prof. Anna K. Nelson of American University. WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
