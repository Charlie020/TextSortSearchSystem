If one were listing pairs of totally unrelated subjects, bridge and the Trojan Wars would certainly qualify. But the two make a memorable combination in a new book by a New Zealander, ''The Bridging of Troy'' by Chris Ackerley. It is available for $12.95 from Barclay Bridge Supplies, 8 Bush Avenue, Box 909, Port Chester N.Y. 10573. The author offers a hilarious revision of the Greek myths, explaining what Homer and Virgil omitted: that bridge games played a vital role in the story of Helen, Paris, Achilles, Hector, Odysseus and the rest. The punny presentation (''all leads roam to Rhodes'') allows the reader to learn, or relearn, the classical legends in painless fashion. Hector's Challenge He will also meet some minor characters, such as Protesilaus who accepted a challenge from Hector: find a way, looking at all four hands, to make four spades on the diagramed deal after the lead of the heart king. Obviously South can collect five trump tricks and four winners in the minor suits. But where is the tenth? There appear to be squeeze chances, but these fail against careful defense. To find out the curious circumstances that permitted Protesilaus to evade the time limit imposed by Hector, the reader of this column must buy the book. But we can reveal that he found a brilliant solution while substantially inebriated: ruff five hearts in the closed hand, so that the 8-7 of trumps in the dummy scores a trick at the finish.
