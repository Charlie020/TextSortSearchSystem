Contracts between surrogate mothers and infertile couples should be recognized as ''legal and enforceable'' in New York State, a report by the State Senate Judiciary Committee has recommended. The report, released yesterday, urges the Legislature to pass laws that would clarify the ambiguous legal status of surrogate motherhood. It also recommends that judicial review be required of all surrogate contracts. The recommendations, which are expected to form the basis of a bill to be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, represent an initial victory for proponents of surrogate motherhood. The recommendations are likely to spark an emotional controversy. Several religious groups, including most recently a group of New Jersey bishops, have condemned surrogate motherhood as a sophisticated form of adultery, and many feminists have decried the renunciation of a mother's rights that the arrangement entails. Opponents of surrogate motherhood, which generally involves a payment to the mother, have deemed the practice baby selling and hence illegal. The hazy legality of surrogate motherhood under current law has been dramatized by the Baby M. case in New Jersey. In that case, which is to go to trial tomorrow, the surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, is fighting to keep the child she conceived through artificial insemination and had agreed to relinquish to its father, William Stern.
