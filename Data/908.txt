908|1987\01\04|Ewe and Cry|To the Sports Editor:|To the Sports Editor: To the Sports Editor: I would like to see more scientific accuracy in the selection of names for athletic teams. I was recently at the Lombardi Center of Fordham University when I chanced upon several members of the women's basketball team. I noticed that their team shirts named them as Lady Rams. To the best of my knowledge, the word ''ram'' is only used to refer to a masculine animal, and when I pointed this out to them they were unable to explain this obvious scientific error. Fordham is considered to be one of the finest educational institutions in this area and it bothered me that they would choose such an uneducated name. I consulted with my father-in-law, who is a scientist and the only Fordham alumnus in my family. He indicated that he couldn't care less about this situation. A suggestion to correct this problem: The female version of a ram is called a ewe and the team should be known as the Fordham U. Ewes, which could be familiarly called the Fordham ''you-yous.'' Now there is a name behind which we can all rally. ROBERT POPISH Blauvelt, N.Y.
