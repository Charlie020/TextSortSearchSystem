Sales for the quarter ended The National Semiconductor Corporation, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it lost $5.7 million in its second quarter, narrowed sharply from the $38.3 million loss reported a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 14 rose 31 percent, to $456.8 million, from $349.2 million a year ago. The second-quarter results included a provision of about $7.5 million related to reductions in employment that were initiated during the quarter. ''During the second quarter, the Semiconductor Group reported a moderate gain in sales and a major improvement in operating performance as compared to the last year,'' Charles E. Sporck, National's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''However, operating performance declined compared to the first quarter because of reduced bookings during the summer.'' Mr. Sporck added that semiconductor order rates have improved since the summer, and he expects that improvement to continue at a modest level in 1987. He also said continued growth for the company would come from a new generation of National Advanced Systems products, the Hitachi mainframe computers that National sells, as well as new point-of-sale products from its Datachecker unit.
