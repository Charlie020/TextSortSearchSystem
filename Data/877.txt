Thousands of United States Army and National Guard troops have been showing the Reagan Administration's military muscle in Honduras virtually continuously since 1982. Last week, Pentagon officials said that 1,100 troops from the United States had begun another joint military exercise that will last until April. United States officials in Honduras said a total of 3,000 would take part. In addition, the country expected this week the first of 4,500 National Guardsmen who will be rotated in until May. The United States contingent will be improving airstrips in southern Honduras near Nicaragua, building a dirt road, and taking part in field maneuvers with Honduran troops, the announcement said. An additional 1,100 troops from the United States are permanently stationed at Palmerola Air Base north of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. Nicaragua has criticized the exercises as provocative, accusing Washington of preparing an invasion. Also last week, officials said President Reagan would ask Congress for another $100 million for the rebels this year, despite opposition expected in the new Democratic-controlled Congress. THE WORLD
