A winner and a loser in last fall's elections offer contrasting answers. Alfonse D'Amato, New York's junior Senator, was a shoo-in for re-election. He nonetheless amassed a huge kitty and, according to Federal Election Commission records, had $653,000 left over. Plans for most of it are unknown, but the Senator is spending $10,000 on self-celebration. He has reserved two Amtrak coaches to take some 200 campaign volunteers, supporters, friends and family on a two-day round trip from New York City to Washington for his swearing-in Tuesday. Vincent Carrafiello, a University of Connecticut professor, lost the Democratic primary for west-central Connecticut's seat in Congress and wound up with a $3,842 surplus. During the campaign he had met 16-year-old John Sherwin, the grandson of some friends, passing out campaign fliers. The young man's mother had recently committed suicide, and the candidate found him in despair. Now, with the election commission's approval, he has created a $3,842 trust fund for John's education. Both uses of the money fall well within the law: winners are allowed to spend surplus funds on expenses as an officeholder, while losers may generally distribute them to political parties, charities or any ''lawful use.'' But where Mr. D'Amato is using his to gild a victory that was already a foregone conclusion, Mr. Carrafiello shows how to put the silver lining of triumph on a loss.
