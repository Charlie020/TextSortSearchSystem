JANUARY 1, 1987, was a red-letter day for Mary Jo Bane: On that date she became a professor of public policy at Harvard University. It was something of a watershed for Harvard as well, since Dr. Bane, an expert on poverty and welfare, is the first tenured female faculty member in the history of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Dr. Bane is in good company. Across the country women are slowly making their way into the higher ranks of academia, for years a bastion of male clubbiness. Since 1975, the number of women college presidents in the United States has doubled, with women now heading more than 300 of the country's approximately 3,000 colleges and universities. During the same period, the number of women Ph.D.'s in full-time academic jobs has grown to just over 50,000, about one-fifth of the nationwide total. But at a time when women constitute the majority of American college students and receive more than one-third of all doctorates, women faculty members and administrators still have many complaints about tenure, promotions and salaries. The phrase used by Lois Weis, a professor of education at the State University of New York at Buffalo, is ''progress but no parity.'' ''We've gotten rid of most of the horror stories, the overt policies and practices that used to harm women,'' said Bernice R. Sandler, director of the Association of American Colleges' Project on the Status and Education of Women. ''But women are still not advancing the way they should, given the number of Ph.D.'s granted.'' Indeed, despite the gains of the last decade, American colleges still have an average of 1.1 women in senior administrative positions, for example. At the same time, the tenure rate for women instructors hovers just below 50 percent, compared to nearly 75 percent for men. And the unemployment rate for women Ph.D.'s, though small, is double that for men, noted Betty Vetter, executive director of the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology. Moreover, the disparity between the salaries of male and female academics is striking. Ms. Vetter, whose Washington-based private, nonprofit group analyzes data compiled by the National Research Council, said that in 1985 the median full-time salary for men with Ph.D.'s in the humanities was $36,100, versus $30,900 for women with the same qualifications. For those with Ph.D.'s in the sciences and engineering, the gap was wider: a median salary of $46,100 for men, $35,600 for women. ''Starting salaries for women faculty members are consistently below those for men in the same field,'' Ms. Vetter said. ''The rule is that the longer the experience, the wider the salary gap. Over the last 10 years, the dollars have changed a lot, but the percentage differential has not, so the dollar difference is big and getting bigger all the time.'' Of growing concern to academic groups is the emergence of a new class of non-tenured instructors, of whom a disproportionate number are women. Statistics compiled by professional groups such as the American Association of University Professors indicate that of the more than 8,000 positions that women hold at the instructor and nonprofessorial levels, more than half are not on the tenure track. Though women hold only a quarter of all full-time faculty positions, about 45 percent of the lower-paid, non-tenure positions are filled by women. Figures gathered by the A.A.U.P. and other professional groups also indicate that these disparities transcend distinctions between colleges that are public or private, celebrated or not; some of the most respected universities in the nation have been identified as prime offenders. The University of Wisconsin at Madison, for example, pays a male full professor an average of $5,000 a year more than his female counterpart, according to the A.A.U.P.'s 1986 survey of academic salaries. And at Harvard, where the sociology department was the scene of a bitter dispute over tenure for a woman a few years ago, in 1985 only 5 percent of the total tenured faculty members, or 45 professors, were women, as against a nationwide average of about 20 percent. In 13 departments, there were no tenured female faculty members at all. Sex-discrimination suits have had mixed results at best. Some, such as the class action brought by faculty and staff members at the City University of New York, have brought multimillion-dollar settlements. And some have foundered as courts have ruled, for instance, that such notions as ''collegiality'' are legitimate considerations in the granting of tenure. Even favorable results in court are no guarantee of redress. When Anna Penk, a tenured professor of mathematics at Western Oregon State College, joined 21 colleagues in suing the state board of higher education, the judge found that she had been discriminated against in promotions but not in salary. Dr. Penk, who had been in the department for 12 years, recalled that while the case was being heard the college hired a former student of hers who had just finished his master's degree. ''The starting salary they gave him,'' she said, ''was $75 a year less than what they paid me.''
