The 3-year-old who won the $1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies race en route to earning $933,650 in 1986 underwent X-rays yesterday morning. She had gone lame after a workout Wednesday. ''She has a fracture in each knee,'' her trainer, Mel Stute, said. ''Dr. Greg Ferraro said she probably would have to have a pin put in each one. There is a chance she could come back.'' Brave Raj, who was bought for $300,000 by Dolly Green in May, is one of the favorites to win an Eclipse Award as the nation's top 2-year-old filly in 1986. . . . George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, will be in Miami today to watch his newly turned 3-year-old gelding Uncle Cam race in the Tropical Park Derby, the first Kentucky Derby prep of the year. Uncle Cam, a winner of three straight in Florida, has yet to run against top horses in his age group but is the 5-2 morning-line favorite. SPORTS PEOPLE
