In the article, a designer states that because of this trend fashion is no longer ''untouchable,'' but ''real.'' Real to whom? The average American woman (at 5 feet 3 1/2 inches) has a 36-29-39 figure and weighs 143 pounds. Logically, one would assume that the industry's most lucrative tactic would be to design clothes that make the greatest number of women look good. Instead, the industry creates an ideal that few can attain and then designs beautiful clothes to adorn this fantasy figure. Is it surprising that most 10-year-old girls have been on diets and that 10 percent of high-school girls are bulimic?  BARBARA HEGGIE  Durham, N.C.
