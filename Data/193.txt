It was another 5 1/2 lengths to Beat It Kid, one of two fillies among the starters. Feeling Gallant, the favorite, finished fast after lagging early and was fourth. Fabulous Move was saddled by his owner-trainer, Oscar Barrera, who was honored earlier in the day as New York's leading trainer for the fourth straight year. The 4-year-old son of Le Fabuleux-Petite Luci carried 111 pounds and was ridden by Chris Antley. He earned $54,000 and returned $18.80 for $2 to win as the third choice. He went two and a quarter miles on the fast track in 3:56 to register his seventh victory in 32 starts this year.
