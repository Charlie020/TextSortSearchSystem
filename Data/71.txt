The Allied Stores Corporation's shareholders have approved the $3.5 billion acquisition of the big New York-based retailer by the Campeau Corporation. Toronto-based Campeau's takeover plan specified that each share of Allied common stock that Campeau does not already own will be converted into $69 in cash if the takeover was completed by yesterday. Campeau, one of Canada's biggest real estate developers, already owned 27.9 million Allied shares as of yesterday. It had bought 25.8 million shares in a block for $67 a share, for a total price of about $1.73 billion. The price paid for the other 2 million or so shares was not available, a Campeau spokesman said. There were 52.3 million shares of Allied stock outstanding on Dec. 1, so Campeau had some 24.4 million shares left to purchase at the agreed-upon price of $69 apiece, or about $1.68 billion. The acquisition - based on the amounts Campeau has already spent and will spend -will cost about $3.5 billion. COMPANY NEWS
