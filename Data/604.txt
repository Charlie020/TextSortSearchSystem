A $22 million lawsuit against a Cypriot freighter that ran aground in the Florida Keys, damaging a coral reef, has been settled out of court for $6.2 million, according to Federal officials. Irving Pianin, a lawyer with the Justice Department, said of the settlement, ''I personally believe it will deter such accidents in the future by convincing ship owners to hire competent crews and captains capable of reading charts and operating navigational devices.'' Bill Harrigan, manager of the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, the site of the reef, said the settlement would to be paid over 15 years. Owners and operators of the freighter, the M-V Wellwood, have deposited $3 million into an annuity fund that will pay out more then double the principal by the year 2002, said John Keller, the lawyer for the ship owners. The money will go to the Coast Guard, to reimburse it for salvaging costs, and to the Treasury's general fund, lawyers said. The agreement settles a $22 million lawsuit filed Federal District Court against the ship; its owner, the Wellwood Shipping Company; its management, the Hanseatic Shipping Company, and its captain, Christopher Vickers, according to Mr. Keller. Captain Vickers was on his first voyage through the Florida Straits when the 400-foot freighter ran aground in August 1984. The ship spent 12 days lodged on the reef before being freed under supervision of the Coast Guard.
