Searchers today found the wreckage of a single-engine plane that crashed in a heavy rainstorm, killing all six people aboard, the authorities said. The pilot of the plane, a Cessna 210 Centurion, lost contact with air traffic controllers in the storm late Wednesday, the authorities said, and searchers found the wreck near the Panhandle community of Jasper this morning. The pilot had filed a flight plan in Huntsville, Ala., saying the craft was flying to Orlando, said Roger Myers, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, adding that the pilot lost contact with controllers at 11:41 P.M. About 100 people helped search for the plane, according to the Hamilton County Sheriff's Department. The bodies were sent to Jacksonville, where autopsies were to be conducted Friday and the identities of the victims verified, the sheriff's department said.
