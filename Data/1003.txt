By Dorothy Clarke Wilson. (Doubleday, $17.95.) QUEEN DOLLEY: The Life and Times of Dolley Madison. By Dorothy Clarke Wilson. (Doubleday, $17.95.) She was the fourth First Lady. She spelled her name with an ''e,'' unlike the ice cream. She saved the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington when the British sacked the White House in the War of 1812. The legacy of Dolley Madison will probably survive the indignity of this novel as well. Biographical novels can be troublesome because their authors are required to comply somewhat with history and established facts. In the best of the genre, character and story development are as graceful as those we demand in any good fiction. In the case of ''Queen Dolley,'' Dorothy Clarke Wilson seems determined to squeeze every last drop from researched historical detail, and the book - the author's 25th! -staggers under a load of raw material wrapped in a writing style that could be called Had She But Known. Readers who manage to wade through the bad writing and errors in grammar and syntax that can be found on almost every page are rewarded with such tidbits as a description of ''the cleft between her small firm breasts'' in a scene set when Dolley would have been 11 years old. Other highlights are cousin Patrick Henry's declaration at the dinner table, ''But as for me, give me liberty or give me death!'' (it has a certain familiar ring), and lines like: ''Once more, Dolley might have told herself, 'This is where I came in,' for it was the War of 1812 all over again.'' For American history addicts, truly desperate for a fix of you-are-there reading, this book just might do. Might.
