578|1987\01\03|Let's Make the Nobel Prize Tax-Exempt|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: It is wonderful to read every year of Nobel Prizes being awarded to citizens of this country. There is, however, a new note to the award this year that should bring shame, not pride, to our Government: for the first time in history, Nobel Prize awards will be taxed by the United States Government. Because of the tax-reform act of 1986, section 74 of the Internal Revenue Code has been revised to tax any award for scientific or artistic achievement, with the exceptions only of prizes that are assigned to a governmental unit or to a tax-exempt charity. In a country of more than 100 million taxpayers, can't we leave an award of such prestige as this untaxed? It amounts to much less than a penny per taxpayer. And then, the recipient can continue in his or her work with a feeling that all Americans are sharing in the award, that this is truly a case of shared national pride. SEYMOUR LAURETZ Santa Monica, Calif., Dec. 22, 1986 The writer is a certified public accountant.
