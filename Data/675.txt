''Basically, the more stations at a corner, the better.'' ''There's a theory in retailing called the 'gas-station theory,' '' explains Robert Danial, the 28-year-old president of ABN Enterprises, which is co-developing a gleaming new mall in SoHo. ''Basically, the more stations at a corner, the better.'' If the hypothesis is accurate, the retail complex at 430-434 West Broadway between Prince and Spring Streets should benefit from the abundance of chic stores in the area, just south of Houston Street. The 22,000-square-foot mall, called the Heart of West Broadway, will comprise eight stores, a restaurant and an art gallery. Construction should begin this month, with completion scheduled for next fall. Space will rent from $30 to $100 a square foot, depending on location. The three-story structure, designed by Arpad Baksa & Associates and fashioned out of glass, granite and stainless steel, will replace three brick apartment buildings that were demolished last July. Mr. Danial, the general partner of Heart of West Broadway Joint Ventures, has been joined by Albert Monasebian, Zeev Yoles and Aaron Storch in the $10 million project.
