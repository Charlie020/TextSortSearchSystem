New York City won its three-year fare freeze in Albany last week, though from downstate the ice looked a little mushy. The Legislature voted to finance the freeze and an $8.6 billion rebuilding of the city's mass-transit system and commuter lines, but postponed trying to resolve a dispute over how to raise the crucial $735 million. That decision was put off with a March 15 deadline for again considering such unpopular proposals as a new property tax on motor vehicles. Ending a 19-day special session that occasionally erupted in shouts, Democrats won a grudging surrender from suburban and upstate Republicans by agreeing to increase spending on highways and provide direct state aid to commuter rail lines. The vote, 80 to 36 in the Assembly and 38 to 7 in the Senate, held the transit fare at $1 and also averted fare increases for riders of the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North. Assuming the $735 million is found on schedule, the freeze will last through 1989. Tolls on East River bridges and tunnels will go up 25 cents, to $2, early this year and 25 cents every two years thereafter. The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Robert R. Kiley, called it ''a great day for straphangers and for people in the region.'' But Assemblyman Stephen M. Saland, a Poughkeepsie Republican, warned that fellow upstaters who supported the agreement would ''rue the day.'' And Assemblyman Frederick D. Schmidt of Woodhaven, Queens, who voted for the bill, was cheered when he declared: ''The service is absolutely terrible. If they don't get their act together, they can expect no support from me.''
