To the Editor:  Your article on Nov. 30 entitled ''Manhattan Hotels Break $200 Barrier'' stated that most rooms in New York City are renting for rates for single occupancy for $135, $172 and $200 and going up to $275 a day. But not all hotels are luxury hotels as implied. The article also states that many tourists might be staying in suburban hotels to save money. This really is not necessary since there are many hotels in New York City for tourists of moderate means in the Times Square theatrical district, the 70's, Central Park West, West End Avenue and Columbus Avenue that rent for $60 a day single and $65 double with private bath. Many hotels rent two-room suites for $85 a day with private bath and kitchenettes and are attractively furnished. They are close to city centers and in pleasant neighborhoods convenient to public transportation, parks, museums and theaters. These lovely, medium-priced hotels have excellent accommodations and they are well-run, soundproof and clean, with television and air-conditioning and wall-to-wall carpeting. They do not, however, have swimming pools, jogging tracks or tennis courts. I feel badly when tourists are led to believe that they cannot go to a good hotel in our city for less than $135 a day. New York City caters to all people - the poor, the elderly and the middle class, and not exclusively to the luxury clientele.
