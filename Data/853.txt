The Chadian Army reported today that Libyan planes had dropped napalm on two northern towns and that Libyan ground forces had begun an attack on one of them. An army communique broadcast on Radio Chad said Government forces were ''resisting heroically.'' It said fighting continued in Zouar, in the Tibesti mountains of northwestern Chad. An army communique earlier today said the air attacks, on Zouar and a northeastern oasis town, Fada, ''were mainly aimed at the civilian population.'' It asserted that a Libyan helicopter had been shot down at Fada. Neither communique reported on casualties. The Libyan press agency denied that Libyan forces had staged air attacks and that a helicopter had been lost. Chad reported Friday that it had retaken control of Zouar and Fada, but its officials said today that Zouar was not held definitively by either side. Zouar was reportedly taken by the Libyans six days ago from Chadian rebels who were once their allies. It is a key point on the main track north to Libya. Fada, about 175 miles southeast of the major outpost of Faya-Largeau, had been held by the Libyans for three years until Chadian Government forces reported capturing it Friday. The Libyan Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi says it has no forces in Chad, but France and the United States say several thousand Libyan troops are in northern Chad.
