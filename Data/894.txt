Boone Pickens Jr., the Texas oilman, seems to be getting thinner of skin as he gets thicker of wallet. Mr. Pickens, the chairman of Mesa Petroleum and a well-known player in the corporate take-over game, has lately been feuding with his hometown newspapers, the Amarillo Daily News and Globe Times. Among other things, he objected to their calling him a corporate ''raider.'' ''The Wall Street Journal doesn't even call me a raider anymore,'' he said. Last month, he urged his 400 employees to boycott the publications and threatened to move his company from Amarillo to Dallas. But it appeared last week that bargaining had led to a truce. The papers no longer call him a raider, and the oilman says he thinks they are ''doing a better job.''  HEADLINERS
