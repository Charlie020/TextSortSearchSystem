FACED with an apparent $450,000 budget deficit, the 324 town committee members of Swampscott, Mass., considered a new revenue source: Megabucks, the state lottery. But when the committee met last May to appropriate $100 for a season lottery ticket, the town counsel ruled that it would be illegal to spend public funds for gambling. That did not stop the committee. With permission from the town moderator, the town's commissioner of trust funds, Carl Reardon, passed the hat and collected more than $200 in personal donations from committee members. With it, Swampscott bought two season lottery tickets. ''They are sealed in an envelope here in my vault in Town Hall,'' says the town treasurer, Jack L. Paster. ''We haven't hit yet.  ''I believe all of the winning tickets have been for over $1 million. But, of course, we're not proud; we'll take anything we can get.'' It will be all gravy if the town does win. Its $15,794,799 budget is balanced after all, Mr. Paster says. When the final revenue totals came in, he notes, ''they found that they were not short.''  FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS
