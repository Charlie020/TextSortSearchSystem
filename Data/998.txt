998|1987\01\04|The 'Pal Joey' Cast|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: This reader is ''bothered and bewildered'' by a photograph that appears with Bobby Short's review of ''The Complete Lyrics of Lorenz Hart'' and two other books on the musical theater (Dec. 7). The caption correctly identifies Gene Kelly, who created the title role in ''Pal Joey'' in 1940. But the woman identified as Kay Street is undoubtedly Vivienne Segal, co-star of that distinctly modern Rodgers and Hart musical.  THOMAS A. DELONG  Southport, Conn.
