Venezuela and Egypt have raised their oil prices by up to $1 a barrel and $1.35 a barrel, respectively. The newspaper El Universal reported in Caracas that the Venezuelan state oil company had raised its prices for Venezuelan crude exports to $14.50 a barrel and for petroleum products to $16 a barrel. It was the third increase of Venezuela's crude oil and fourth for its oil products since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided earlier this month to reduce production and raise prices to an average of $18 a barrel. In Egypt, an oil ministry official said that January prices would go up on all grades of its exported oil by $1.35 a barrel. Egypt is not a member of OPEC but sets its prices according to the world market. The official said the OPEC agreement had improved world market prices, allowing the rise in Egyptian prices. The price of Egypt's top-grade Gulf of Suez blend was increased to $16.60 a barrel.
