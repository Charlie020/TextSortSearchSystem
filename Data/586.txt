Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, will be second in line for the Presidency for 72 hours, beginning at noon Saturday, the day before President Reagan enters a hospital for tests and prostate surgery. Senator Thurmond's brief elevation from third to second in Presidential succession is a result of a three-day gap between the end of the 99th Congress and the start of the 100th. The timing of the President's hospitalization, with surgery scheduled for Monday, is coincidental.
