579|1987\01\03|Behind the Campaign Against Rabies Vaccine|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: Your Nov. 11 news article and Nov. 12 editorial on the Wistar Institute's rabies-vaccine research in Argentina requires clarification and amplification. First, these trials were not undertaken overseas to avoid U.S. regulations. They were undertaken in Argentina because outbreaks of bovine rabies there cause losses of $50 million a year. Second, to suggest that the vaccine may ''become more virulent'' (editorial) is fearmongering. The vaccinia virus has been known since Edward Jenner first used it and was cultivated in numerous passages in cattle for production of the lymph vaccine without evidence of its becoming more virulent. There is no evidence that any of the numerous other vaccinia recombinants have become more virulent. The campaign to attack the trial ex post facto was initiated by an Argentine trainee working at the Wistar Institute who had no scientific knowledge about vaccinia virus and its effect on humans and cattle. Nor did he confirm his interpretation with anyone knowledgeable about the experiment before writing a denunciatory letter to the Argentine Government. The reaction within Argentina and the U.S. has been tantamount to a campaign of vilification of the Wistar Institute and the Pan American Health Organization, in whose facilities the trial was conducted. Forgotten are the potential economic benefits to the Argentine cattle industry and the paradoxical fact that the campaign against the trial started after ''the evaluation  [ of the results ]  did not confirm the existence of risks'' (editorial, La Nacion, Buenos Aires, Nov.
