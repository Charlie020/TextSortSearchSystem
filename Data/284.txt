President Reagan, winding up his weeklong vacation here, asked today that he be kept informed about the hotel fire in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a White House statement said. A brief statement issued by his staff said that ''the President and Mrs. Reagan were deeply saddened by the loss of life'' in the hotel fire ''and extend their condolences to the friends and relatives of those who died.'' Mr. Reagan was described as attending to paper work at the estate of his old friend, Walter Annenberg, and is scheduled to return to the White House late Friday. Mark Weinberg, assistant White House press secretary, said the Reagans attended a New Year's Eve party at the estate. Mr. Reagan enters Bethesda Naval Hospital, Maryland, on Sunday for an examination to check for any recurrence of the colon cancer he suffered in July 1985, and for surgery Monday for an enlarged prostate gland.
