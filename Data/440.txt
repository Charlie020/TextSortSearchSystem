A confusing letter arrived the other day in the office of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. It came from Jackie Presser, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and it congratulated the Senator on his ''well-deserved election victory.'' But Senator Moynihan was last re-elected in 1982 and thus will not be eligible again for such good wishes, if at all, until late in 1988. Mr. Presser, not generally known as a kidder, is currently under indictment for embezzlement of union funds and has been identified by Government officials in the past as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A Moynihan aide said of the letter: ''If Presser can't get this straight, what does he tell the F.B.I.?''  WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
