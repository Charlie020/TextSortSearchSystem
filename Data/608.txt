The Shell Oil Company has agreed to pay $180 million to settle longstanding allegations that it violated Federal oil-pricing and allocation controls in effect between 1973 and 1981, the Energy Department said today. The settlement is one of the largest in a program that has yielded $5.7 billion in overcharge levies from more than 1,000 cases. Fewer than 40 remain unresolved, according to a spokesman. When the settlement becomes final, after a 30-day comment period and a public hearing, Shell is to pay $20 million for refiner-pricing issues. It will be distributed by the Energy Department under a special refund proceeding in which those victimized may press claims. Another $160 million, reflecting crude-oil-pricing issues, would be divided between the Treasury and the states after 20 percent is reserved for the special proceeding. The company said in a statement that the levies, which were neither fines nor penalties, resulted from differing interpretations of complex Federal regulations. It added that it had agreed to pay the money to avoid further prolonged litigation and to remove uncertainties.
