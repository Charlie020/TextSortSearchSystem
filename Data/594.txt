West Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, warned today against a trade war between the United States and the European Community following the American decision to impose 200 percent tariffs on some community farm products. ''That is the last thing we need,'' Mr. Genscher said of a possible trade war. He made his remarks in an interview with WDR radio of Cologne. Separately, Martin Bangemann, West German's Economic Minister, said the American move was just for show and would not have much effect on West German agriculture. Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, said Tuesday that the new import duties would be imposed starting at the end of January unless an agreement was reached on compensation for American feed grain markets lost when Spain and Portugal joined the European Community last year. The tariffs would affect goods including white wine, gin, brandy, cheese, olives, carrots and canned ham. Mr. Genscher said the tariff announcement came just as the community had managed to reduce some commodity surpluses. He also said the entry of Spain and Portugal into the European Community was not sufficient reason for the United States action.
