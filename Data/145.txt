The subjects are as diverse as Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Pope John XXIII and Charles Lindbergh. Today, a selection of 25 original paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures that were used for Time magazine covers of the past will go on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery. The exhibit is titled ''Man of the Year: Portraits from the Time Collection.'' According to the portrait gallery historian and curator of the exhibit, Frederick S. Voss, the collection is of consequence because the magazine covers ''evoke the major events of our past.'' Mr. Voss notes, for example, that the 1972 Man of the Year cover displayed Richard M. Nixon and that the following year it carried the likeness of a key figure in the undoing of his Presidency, Judge John J. Sirica. Pope John appeared in 1962, the first year of Vatican II, which brought sweeping change to the Roman Catholic Church. It was not until the next year, 1963, more than 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, that the first black Man of the Year, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., appeared on the cover.
