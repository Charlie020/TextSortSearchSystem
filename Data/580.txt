580|1987\01\03|Slow and Fast Solutions on Teen-Age Pregnancy|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: As members of the panel on adolescent pregnancy and childbearing of the National Research Council, which recommended free or low-cost distribution of contraceptives to teen-agers, we regret that your treatment of our report (front page, Dec. 9) failed to convey the context of those recommendations. We spent more than two years trying to unravel the web of conditions in our country that result in so many unintended births to teen-age mothers. As the panel chairman, Daniel Federman, stated in the preface to the report: ''Many social circumstances are closely related to the problem of teen-age pregnancy and childbearing. Youth unemployment, poverty, poor education, single-parent families, television content. The hope for a solution to the problem of teen-age pregnancy is illusory without simultaneous amelioration of some of these contributing factors. Pending such comprehensive change, the panel urges prevention rather than denial, kindness rather than exhortation and research rather than doctrine.'' The panel recommended a wide range of research and programs directed toward improving school achievement and job placement, in order to expand opportunities for disadvantaged youth. JOY G.
