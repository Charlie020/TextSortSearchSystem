O'Neill, the Speaker of the House who is retiring, said today. President Reagan is an ill-informed leader whose luck has run out since the disclosure of the Iran arms sale crisis, Thomas P. O'Neill, the Speaker of the House who is retiring, said today. ''Of all the eight presidents I've known, on any issue, he knows less than any President I've ever met or has been in the White House,'' Mr. O'Neill said in an interview with a television station in Boston. ''He's been lucky,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''He's been built by the media of America.'' Mr. O'Neill said he told Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, before Mr. Reagan's re-election in 1984 that the President would stumble in his second term. ''He's going to stumble because you know and I know that he hasn't got the talent, he hasn't got the ability, that he's been lucky,'' Mr. O'Neill said he told the Mr. Laxalt, who is a close friend of Mr. Reagan. ''Somewhere along the line, he's going to stumble, and the American people are going to find out how that White House really operates.'' Mr. O'Neill said he considered President Carter ''the most brilliant man I ever met, absolutely the most talented. He had the worst staff around him I ever saw. He could have accomplished so much.'' The Speaker also said Senator Gary Hart of Colorado was leading the race for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination. ''He's going to be hard to beat,'' Mr. O'Neill said, adding, ''He's not my cup of tea.''
