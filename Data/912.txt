912|1987\01\04|Pass the Hat|To the Sports Editor:|To the Sports Editor: To the Sports Editor: If the Mets are so poor that they can't pay Ray Knight $200,000 more to get him back next year, I'm sure that 200,000 fans would be happy to contribute $1 each to do so. Knight is right in asking for $1 million. He knows what he's worth, and so do the fans - even if the Mets' management doesn't. EDWARD PRESTON New York
