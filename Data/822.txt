Officials of the Florida Power Corporation shut down the utility's nuclear power plant after a weakened seal increased pressure on other seals in the reactor coolant system, a spokesman said. The plant, which had been shut down in November and restarted Dec. 25, was operating at 40 percent capacity when the reactor was shut down Friday, said Mark Jacobs, a spokesman for the utility. He said pressure started to rise Thursday on the first of three seals of one of the four coolant pumps. Company officials ordered the shutdown after the first seal weakened and put additional pressure on two back-up seals. The coolant system transfers heat from the reactor core to a steam generator.
