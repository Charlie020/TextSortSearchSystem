Conducted by Bernard Haitink, 1986. HBO/Cannon Video. 181 minutes. $49.95 Both as a youth and in his last years, Mozart paid homage to the Baroque. Late in life it was Bach's contrapuntal style he enjoyed emulating. At 25, however, he turned to opera seria - music drama based on ancient themes and grandly static in its elaborate set pieces. Into ''Idomeneo'' Mozart injected a sense of motion and fluidity uncommon to his predecessors. His arias were masterpieces of a dying but still influential style (just as his later fugal writing out-Bached Bach). Mozart wrote the great role of Idamante for castrato soprano. In this handsome Glyndebourne production, it is taken by Jerry Hadley, a tenor who struggles uncomfortably with its high tessitura. Philip Langridge is imposing yet unaffected in the title role, but he too has his struggles with Mozart's ornateness. Yvonne Kenny is the sweet-voiced Ilia, with Carol Vaness as Electra. HOME VIDEO
