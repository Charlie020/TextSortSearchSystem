Czechoslovak authorities ordered Tuesday that three members of a banned cultural group who were arrested in September be released, but they remained in custody pending an appeal of the order, an emigre source said. The source identified the three as Cestmir Hunat, Tomas Krivanek and Vlastimil Drda, members of the defunct Czech Musicians Union's Jazz Section, which opposes state censorship of the arts. Seven Jazz Section activists were arrested in September on suspicion of conducting illegal business, mainly publishing unauthorized works. Two of the group were released Sunday because of ill health. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said authorities did not revoke investigative custody for the remaining two. Founded in 1971, the Jazz Section's nationwide membership of about 7,000 advocates freedom in the arts and opposes controls exerted by the Communist authorities.
