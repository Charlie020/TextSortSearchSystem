By The Jerusalem Post. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $15.95.) ANATOLY AND AVITAL SHCHARANSKY: The Journey Home. By The Jerusalem Post. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $15.95.) This is a quickie book by the staff of The Jerusalem Post, Israel's English-language daily, put together rapidly after Anatoly Shcharansky, the Jewish dissident, was released from a Russian labor camp last February and joined his wife, Avital, in Israel. Unlike many of its genre, however, this volume has the style and coherence of an extensively researched and carefully written documentary. It provides sketches of the couple's family life, details of his activities on behalf of the Jewish emigration movement (albeit with some minor factual errors, including a slightly inaccurate account of his arrest) and some engrossing descriptions of his life in prison and his fellow inmates' ingenious methods of communicating with him. It also contains the first behind-the-scenes accounts of some of the abortive efforts over the years to negotiate his release, as well as the final, successful effort last winter. The Post authors also put Mr. and Mrs. Shcharansky in an Israeli context, discussing the evolution of her intimacy with religious rightists, who supported her campaign to free her husband, and the conflicting tugs on Mr. Shcharansky from religious and political interests after he got to Israel. Though less extensive than Martin Gilbert's ''Shcharansky,'' this volume provides fascinating new insights into the Shcharansky saga.
