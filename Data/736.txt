736|1987\01\04|Knight's Impact|To the Sports Editor:|To the Sports Editor: To the Sports Editor: There have been a number of letters expressing anger and regret at the Mets for allowing Ray Knight to explore free agency. Although he did have a good year, it was not the difference in the Mets' winning the National League East by 20 games. But if you want to evaluate him using that criterion, think about it this way: If Ray Knight had been merely average the two previous years, when the Mets finished second, they probably would have won the East both years. So in a very real sense, Ray Knight cost the Mets the East championship two years in a row. RICHARD GEISMAR New York
