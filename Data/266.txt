Iraq said its warplanes carried out intensive raids on military and economic targets deep inside Iran today. A communique by the high command said the aircraft had made a destructive raid on Iran's main oil terminal at Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf ''to prevent any repair works by the Iranian authorities.'' Iraqi planes have attacked Kharg more than 130 times since August 1985 in a bid to stop the oil exports on which Teheran depends to finance its war. The communique said other aircraft attacked the Kaj Saran oilfield, destroying refining and production units. It did not further identify the oilfield, which does not appear on maps. It said several squadrons of jets had attacked Iranian revolutionary guard headquarters and troops massed close to the warfront, destroying 145 military vehicles and killing many soldiers. The communique said all aircraft had returned safely to base.
