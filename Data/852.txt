A total of 22 people were killed when a Spanish Air Force plane crashed off the coast of Equatorial Guinea on Friday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said tonight. She said the dead included the wife and five children of the Trade and Industry Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Fortunato Nzambi Machinde. Half of the victims were Spanish, including nuns and a priest doing voluntary work in the former Spanish colony, she said. The remaining 11 were Guineans, among them a nun and a military officer described as director general of cooperation. The Government sent an air force transport plane to bring home the bodies of the Spanish victims today while the Ambassador to Equatorial Guinea traveled to the scene of the accident. The death toll had originally been put at 18 by the Spanish Foreign Ministry and was revised to 15 this morning. The accident occurred shortly after the twin-engine Aviocar took off from the mainland town of Bata on a routine flight to the Guinean capital of Malabo, 190 miles to the north on the island of Bioco, the Foreign Ministry said. The plane failed to gain height and plunged into the sea. The Foreign Ministry said the victims included the Mother Superior and deputy secretary of the Calasancia order, who had been visiting the order's missions over Christmas. The others included three nuns and a priest of the Salesian order; the priest's sister, who had also been visiting over Christmas; a doctor, and the three crew members.
