Lester, one of three defendants in the Howard Beach incident, was released from the Rikers Island jail yesterday after posting $25,000 bail. Jon L. Lester, one of three defendants in the Howard Beach incident, was released from the Rikers Island jail yesterday after posting $25,000 bail. The other two defendants, Scott Kern, 17 years old, and Jason Ladone, 16, both of Howard Beach, Queens, were freed on bail Monday after murder and assault charges against the three youths were dismissed. They still face reckless endangerment charges. A spokesman for the City Department of Correction, James Whitford, said Mr. Lester, 17 of Ozone Park, left the jail about 3 P.M. Mr. Whitford could not say if the sum was paid in cash or by bond, which would have required an action by a judge. Mr. Lester's attorney, Bryan Fielder Levinson, said yesterday that neighbors had started a fund for his defense. ''I understand there are some people trying to help his mother out with legal fees and bail,'' he said. The lawyer said he did not know Mr. Lester's whereabouts. Mr. Levinson said he did not believe the beating of three blacks by a gang of white youths in Howard Beach Dec. 20 was a racial incident. ''This was a confrontation, but it was blown up that way,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''If you had a situation where blacks came into the neighborhood and someone said 'Let's attack the blacks,' that's a racial incident. But if two groups get into a confrontation, and they call each other names, that's just people. Some do it and some don't. But the cause is a confrontation.''
