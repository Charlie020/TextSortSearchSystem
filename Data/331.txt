Many people took time out from their holiday preparations to send a contribution to the 75th annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In a letter accompanying a gift of $5,000 in memory of his parents, Meta and Adolf Schmidt, Frederick P. Schmidt of Oradell, N.J., said, ''I can think of no better way to fulfill this tribute than by helping the less fortunate and in need through the medium of the Neediest Cases Fund.'' The Neediest Cases Fund affirms ''that indeed we are all our brothers' and sisters' keepers,'' said R. and Mrudulla Gnanadesikan of Chatham, N.J., who gave $150. ''My sister and I are each giving up one of our Hanukkah presents and donating the money'' said Joanna Winograd of Farmington, Conn., who with her sister, Eliza, gave $20. Patricia Reiss of Lake Forest, Ill., gave $10, saying ''this is my gift to a dear friend who loves New York City and who, like me, prays for its people.'' Barbara L. Cutler of Manhasset, L.I., who gave $100, said: ''Our family has instituted a new way of celebrating the holidays. We give gifts only to the little children. All the adults are sending checks to help the poor.'' '' The misery and the poverty amid the glitter of the New York streets during this time of year is a sight to behold. Such brutal extremes,'' said Ninao Popova of Sea Cliff, L.I., who gave $35. Other gifts were received from Denis Collins of Freeport, L.I., $400; Colleen and John F.
