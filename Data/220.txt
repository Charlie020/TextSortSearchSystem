Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, said that he did, but that he doubted whether the N.C.A.A. would listen to him. ''I wouldn't have the clout that St. Joe would,'' he said. Johnson then began trying to mitigate the flippancy of his remark, saying it had been made partly in jest but also out of respect for Joe Paterno, his Penn State counterpart, ''for all the fantastic things he has done for college football.'' He did not sound convincing. An hour later, Paterno arrived for his own daily interview, having already been briefed about Johnson's comment. ''I left my halo home,'' he said, a mischievous look in his eye as he stepped toward the podium. And, of his casual dress, he added: ''I wanted to wear one of my unsaintly outfits.'' That made it 2-1, St. Joe, and then Paterno started running up the score. Near the end of the interview, when asked how his team would spend the afternoon awaiting game time tomorrow night, he said: ''We'll sit around and pray a little. I say mass every day.''  SCOUTING
