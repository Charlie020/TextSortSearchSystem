Penner said last October that he would resign in January as director of the Congressional Budget Office, one of the nation's top posts for an economist. But even with a few months' notice, he is proving hard to replace. Mr. Penner, who says he will decide in a couple of weeks which of a number of offers he will accept, is what economists call a mainstream conservative. In his three years at the budget agency, which tries to bring accuracy and objective underpinning to judgments about the economy and Federal budgets, he managed to survive with little partisan criticism. Still, to maintain some balance at the agency and to take account of the Democratic majorities in both houses as of next Tuesday when the 100th Congress convenes, aides to senior members of Congress say they have been looking for a successor with more liberal credentials. One of their quarry was Barry P. Bosworth, who was the No. 1 inflation fighter in the Carter White House and is now at the Brookings Institution. ''My gentle answer was no,'' Mr. Bosworth said in reponse to an inquiry about overtures to succeed Mr. Penner. He then noted his reservations with some candor: ''Too much administrative work. It's a big organization, and it needs a good administrator. Another thing that discouraged me was trying to deal with so many people who are your boss.''  WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
