The number of tenant complaints over the lack of heat and hot water have so far this season continued at a lower pace than a year ago, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development announced yesterday. The city agency reported that from Oct. 1 to Dec. 20 it received 88,408 complaints, compared with 123,816 for the same period in 1985. Of the complaints received from Oct. 1 to Dec. 20, the agency said, 5,721 resulted in violations against landlords for failing to provide heat and hot water. In 1,189 cases, the city ordered emergency repairs and in 1,274 incidents the city began court action against landlords. In 1985, violations were issued in 7,219 cases, repairs were ordered in 1,477 cases and court action begun in 1,322. A department spokesman, Charles Perkins, said the reason for the decline in the number of complaints was not clear. ''It's been a milder winter so far,'' he said. ''We would like to think landlords know we mean business and are providing heat, but we can't prove that.''  METRO DATELINES
