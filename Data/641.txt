641|1987\01\04|FROM 'NAPOLEON' TO MOZART TO SINCLAIR LEWIS|'Arrowsmith'|'Arrowsmith' 'Arrowsmith' Starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes. Directed by John Ford. 1931. Embassy Home Entertainment. 101 minutes. $39.95. In this era of DNA, RNA, electron microscopes and genetic engineering, there is something extremely quaint about the kind of scientists who were called microbe hunters. As depicted in this adaptation (by Sidney Howard) of the Sinclair Lewis novel, they are people who puff cigarettes around culture incubators, brew serums in their kitchens, refer to germs as ''bugs'' and treat both bubonic plague virus and their wives with fatal condescension. Still, the current of idealism that pervades this story of Dr. Martin Arrowsmith and of the conflict between pure science and humanity, and between altruistic inquiry and the prospect of fame and money, proves bracing in this more cynical age. Both science and performance styles have changed greatly since this movie was made, and the videocassette provides a valuable medium for pondering the differences. HOME VIDEO
