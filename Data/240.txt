240|1987\01\02|Pension Raise Needed|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: New York lawmakers must consider legislation to supplement state employee pensions that have been ravaged the last few years by inflation. Between 1978 and 1985, employer agencies in the state obtained rate reduction from the employees retirement system of more than $2 billion. None of this went to state retirees.  Comptroller Edward V. Regan has released a report showing a drastic reduction in the cost of state retiree pensions from 22.4 percent of payroll in 1978 to the 15.5 percent estimated for this state fiscal year. Legislators can no longer ignore the need to supplement the pensions of state public servants. WILLIAM H. GINSBERG  Director, New York State Retirees  Public Employees Federation  New York, Dec. 9, 1986
