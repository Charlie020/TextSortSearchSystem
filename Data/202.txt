A Federal judge has overturned a $4.3 million discrimination award to 13 white Chicago police officers who charged they had been transferred from prestigious jobs because of their race and politics. The officers contended in a lawsuit that they had been transferred because they were white and supported Mayor Jane M. Byrne in the 1983 election in which she was defeated by Harold Washington. In early September a jury awarded each of the officers $55,000 in compensatory damages and $275,000 in punitive damages, more than the $250,000 sought in the lawsuit. In his ruling Tuesday, Judge Milton I. Shadur said the trial had produced no evidence of political discrimination, although he noted that a reasonable juror might have concluded there was some evidence of racial discrimination. Judge Shadur reversed a jury's finding that the 13 were entitled to punitive damages. He also said three of the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensatory damages. The judge also ruled that Raleigh Mathis, former executive director of the Office of Municipal Investigations, who along with the city was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, was not personally liable for any damages. Judge Shadur reversed the jury's finding of racial discrimination against three of the officers and requested additional information from eight plaintiffs. He gave two officers the option of accepting $15,000 each in compensatory damages or requesting a new trial to determine damages.
