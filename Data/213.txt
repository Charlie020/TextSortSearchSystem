Citizens for America, President Reagan's steadfast grass-roots lobby, will hold an old-fashioned public rally on Monday to show support for the President amid the Iran arms affair. The noon rally, to be held at Lafayette Park across from the White House, will feature free food and refreshments and a lineup of speakers led by Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York and Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, an unswerving ally of the President. Buses are being lined up to transport the faithful from as far away as Boston. At the rally, supporters will pass out buttons and bumper stickers bearing the slogan ''America's with Reagan.'' And an old-time jazz band will play. The organizers invited other prominent Republicans to speak. The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, declined; he must prepare for the opening of the 100th Congress the following day but did not give the organizers that excuse or any other reason for not joining the rally. Vice President Bush, who, like both Mr. Kemp and Mr. Dole, is a likely 1988 Presidential contender, was also invited to speak, ''and has indicated his schedule is free but has not decided whether to speak,'' according to David Carmen, one of the organizers. The President himself enters Bethesda Naval Hospital on Sunday night for prostate surgery on Monday. WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
