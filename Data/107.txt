The Indian sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar was in satisfactory condition yesterday after undergoing heart surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital, a hospital spokesman said. ''He did have heart surgery and he's in satisfactory condition,'' the spokesman, Jean Brett, said. The surgery took place on Tuesday. Ms. Brett said she was unable to give details about the operation, but added that Mr. Shankar, 66 years old, had undergone diagnostic tests at the hospital on Monday. Mr. Shankar, who has been greatly responsible for popularizing Indian music in the West, said on Friday that he had suffered from angina for some time and that it had been kept under control with medicine. He said he had come to New York for tests because the condition had worsened.
