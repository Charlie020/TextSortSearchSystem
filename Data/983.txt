To the Editor: The report on irksome air traffic delays (Practical Traveler, Dec. 7) was pertinent as I can verify from many years of air travel. Why not practice the traditional dictum that ''Honesty Is the Best Policy'' and instruct all United States airlines to print in bold letters on their schedules ''Scheduled Times Are Approximate Only''?
