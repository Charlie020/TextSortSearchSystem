Drivers who park illegally on city streets soon may start finding stickers from the Department of Sanitation glued to their car windows, the agency's commissioner said yesterday. ''We just want to get their attention,'' the commissioner, Brendan Sexton, said. Hot water and a razor will be needed to remove the stickers, he added. The plan reflects the department's frustration with drivers who ignore alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules and block street sweepers. ''If the parker is interfering, we're going to allow him to understand more completely what that parking violation means,'' Mr. Sexton said in a telephone interview. ''It's an informational piece.'' The sticker, the size of a piece of looseleaf paper, says: ''This vehicle violates New York City Parking Regulations. As a result, this street could not be properly cleaned. A cleaner New York is up to you.'' Drivers will also get a parking ticket and could face towing. The program could start as early as next month, Mr. Sexton said. METRO DATELINES
