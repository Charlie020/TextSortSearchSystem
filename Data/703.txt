Lee A. Iacocca, who has done the difficult as a corporate executive, last week did the unheard of as a perceived Presidential contender: He declared himself out of the running on the ground that he might not be up to the job. Mr. Iacocca gained national fame when he was widely credited with bringing the Chrysler Corporation back from the brink of bankruptcy, but he said America's future economic problems might be beyond his ken. In an interview, he mused about national policy options in the event of a serious economic downturn, concluding, ''I'll be damned if I know. That's why I don't want to be President.'' Instead, Mr. Iacocca said he would stay on as the chairman of Chrysler at least until he turned 65 years old on Oct. 15, 1989. HEADLINERS
