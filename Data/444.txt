The Bank of France raised interest rates sharply today to support the franc as worries about the French economy helped send the currency plunging against the West German mark. The bank announced a rise in its key intervention rate to 8 percent, from 7.25 percent, effectively pushing up interest rates throughout the French money markets. Bankers and stockbrokers said the central bank's move reflected deepening strains on the economy from the combination of a 16-day-old strike by railmen and a weak dollar, which touched off a run of capital into West Germany. The rate increase came as the franc slid on the Paris market to within two centimes of the 3.3303 mark level at which, under the European Monetary System, the central bank must intervene to support it. The franc was fixed officially at 3.3120 marks, down from 3.3093 before the New Year's holiday. The European Monetary System links the currencies of eight West European countries.
