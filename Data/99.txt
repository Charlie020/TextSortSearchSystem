Raw-boned, old-fashioned Chicago blues has a new young master - Li'l Ed Williams, who led his band, the Blues Imperials, Monday at the Lone Star Cafe. The 31-year-old Li'l Ed, who works at a car wash and studied with the bluesman J. B. Hutto, sings and plays slide guitar with a fierce disregard for the steps of the well-tempered scale. He uses his fingers and fingernails instead of a pick, and while the Blues Imperials chug crisply along behind him, Li'l Ed's shivering, keening guitar solos recapture the vocalistic cries of deep Delta blues. Mr. Williams, who wears a fez on stage like Mr. Hutto, is a cheerful showman. He belts his songs in a gutsy baritone, but his guitar solos are the heart of his sets. For longer solos, he would walk out into the audience, holding his guitar up to listeners, dropping to his knees, leaning back like a limbo dancer or even scuttling - forward and backward, on his knees - as he played. The material in Monday's late set was basic Chicago blues, devoted to loneliness and resilience. Li'l Ed and the Blues Imperials made the songs heartfelt and rowdy, without a hint of funk or jazz to dilute the blues. For them, the tradition is alive.
