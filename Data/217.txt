Ruling from the bench because of the short time before the New Year's Day kickoff, United States District Judge Robert Collins said A Federal judge in New Orleans upheld a National Collegiate Athletic Association ruling forbidding Roland Barbay, the Louisiana State defensive end, from playing in the Sugar Bowl because tests showed he had used steroids last spring. Ruling from the bench because of the short time before the New Year's Day kickoff, United States District Judge Robert Collins said Barbay had failed to show there was a constitutional issue involved. Prior to the ruling, an N.C.A.A. lawyer read sworn testimony in which Barbay contradicted his earlier public statement that he had taken the steroid on the advice of a physician. Of some 2,000 football players tested this bowl season, 11 have shown positive for steroid use. Barbay is the only one known to have gone to court over the matter. Barbay's lawyer, Nick Noriea, said that even if Judge Collins had declared Barbay eligible for today's L.S.U.'s game today in the Sugar Bowl against Nebraska, his client would have been benched either by Coach Bill Arnsparger or under orders of the school.
