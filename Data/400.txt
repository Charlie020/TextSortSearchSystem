Brent Fullwood, the consensus all-America senior tailback, ran for 152 yards and a touchdown today to lead Auburn to a 16-7 victory over Southern Cal in the Florida Citrus Bowl. It was the third consecutive defeat for Southern Cal (7-5) and for Coach Ted Tollner, who was dismissed at the end of the regular season following losses to U.C.L.A. and Notre Dame. Tollner finished his four-year stint with a 26-20-1 record. Fullwood, who gained 1,391 yards during the regular season, ran for 52 yards on 10 carries on Auburn's first scoring drive. Then he ran 4 yards for the go-ahead touchdown in the second quarter. After the game he said the effort ''was one of my most satisfying 'cause they were rude.'' ''They were one of the rudest teams we've ever played,'' Fullwood said. ''Instead of playing ball, they wanted to fight.'' A Most-Valuable Linebacker The Auburn defense, led by the game's most valuable player - Aundray Bruce, a 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound junior linebacker - forced a fumble to set up the go-ahead touchdown and pressured the Southern Cal quarterback, Rodney Peete, throughout the game. Peete's second-quarter fumble after a hit by Bruce led to Auburn's go-ahead touchdown, and Tracy Rocker caught Peete in the end zone to give Auburn the 9-point lead with 8 minutes 51 seconds to play. Peete, who became the first sophomore to pass for more than 2,000 yards in a season at Southern Cal, suffered four interceptions and was sacked five times, including four by Bruce, who was delighted that the Trojans did not make a special effort to stop him. ''They were doubling up on our linemen, so that gave me the opportunity,'' he said. ''They were playing me one-on-one, and I don't feel that anyone can stop me that way.'' Auburn, which finished in a four-way tie for second place in the Southeastern Conference, completed the season with a 10-2 record and the 500th victory in the school's history. Peete, who passed for 2,025 yards during the season, completed 12 of 30 for 113 yards. Auburn's Jeff Burger passed for 90 yards and had two passes intercepted in a defensive struggle marked by nine turnovers. #44 Yards Rushing for U.S.C. Auburn limited Southern Cal to 157 yards - 44 rushing on 30 carries -and 10 first downs. Auburn gained 200 of its 290 total yards on 62 rushing attempts, including 28 by Fullwood. Southern Cal's lone touchdown came when a linebacker, Marcus Cotton, returned an inteception 24 yards in the first quarter. Auburn tied at 7-7 after Burger passed 3 yards to a tight end, Walter Reeves, for the touchdown. The Trojans had a golden opportunity for a touchdown late in the game after a blocked punt gave them the ball at the Auburn 7-yard line. However, Auburn stopped Leroy Holt on fourth down from the 1.
