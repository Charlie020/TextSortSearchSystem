Skiers arriving by train from Montreal were met by horse-drawn sleighs and driven to pensions to be warmed by steaming pea soup, tourtiere - and whisky, banned in the United States, but legal in Whisky helped fuel the development of the Laurentian Mountains in French Canada as a holiday area for Americans during the prohibitionist 1920's. Skiers arriving by train from Montreal were met by horse-drawn sleighs and driven to pensions to be warmed by steaming pea soup, tourtiere - and whisky, banned in the United States, but legal in Canada. Today, much of the same hospitality and joie de vivre are still to be found at a score of ski centers and neighboring towns. The closest is less than a one-hour drive from downtown Montreal, and especially attractive to Americans because the United States dollar is worth $1.40 in Canada. The region is primarily French-speaking, but English is spoken in all hotels and most restaurants and ski centers. Skiing Serious skiers head for Mont Tremblant (819-425-8711 or 800-567-6761 from the Eastern United States). At 3,001 feet it's the tallest of the skiing Laurentians, good-sized rolling hills best suited for novice-to-intermediate downhill skiing and cross-country touring. Eighty miles north of Montreal, Mont Tremblant has 33 runs, from the harrowing Flying Mile, a steep, narrow chute, to the gentle Sissy Schuss, almost three miles long and wide as a golf fairway. Skiers take two chairlifts, or about 20 minutes plus another 15 in a lift line, to reach the summit. A lift ticket costs $15 to $18 a day or $78 for five days, with a four-day lesson package of $60. For skiers aged 6 to 12 and over 65, it's $12 daily and $53 for five days; children under 6 ski for free. (All prices are given in United States dollars.) Mont St. Sauveur (514-227-4671), one hour from downtown Montreal, is among the largest - 22 runs - and most popular centers in the southern Laurentians, attracting up to 5,000 skiers on a busy Sunday. A second four-passenger chairlift was installed this year, and it has reduced the wait on lift lines from about 20 minutes to 15. Tickets are $14 weekdays, $15 on weekends; children under four ski for free, five to 12 for $8; those over 60 pay $12. Five-day tickets cost $50. Mont St. Sauveur, along with Ski Morin Heights (514-226-1333) in Morin Heights and Vallee Bleu (819-322-3427) in Val David have added child care this year (approximately $7 a day). Auberge Mont Gabriel (514-229-3547), a resort hotel with its own ski hill near the town of Mont Rolland, and Mont St. Sauveur, with 97 percent of its trails lighted for night skiing, are favorites after dark and both have insulating cushions on their chairlifts. A four-passenger chairlift that opened this season at Mont Gabriel will serve a new advanced-level run, the Coup du Monde, site of the only Canadian stop of the World Cup of Acrobatic Skiing this Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The Far Hills Inn (819-322-2014 or 800-567-6636), three miles east of Val Morin, is the acknowledged leader in organizing cross-country ski touring ($2 for nonguests), rentals and instruction. Seventy miles of trails, over frozen lakes and wooded mountains, connect with the Maple Leaf Trail and a total Laurentian network of about 2,500 miles, including 30 miles of trails of the resort hotel l'Esterel (514-228-2571) in Ville d'Esterel, where ski-school director Bill Deskin trains older people as well as blind and disabled skiers. Where to Stay Le Chantecler in Ste. Adele (514-229-3555) offers the most complete package in the southern Laurentians. Big enough to accommodate more than 300, the large fieldstone manor house has a comfortable country look with knotty pine walls, brass corridor lamps and rooms with large windows, newly decorated with traditional pine furniture and calico quilts. A six-night rate of $400 a person includes breakfast and dinner, seven days' skiing on Le Chantecler's 22-run hill and cross-country trails, ski instruction by a team of 70 and access to an indoor fitness center, pool and racquet courts. Two nights with three days of skiing and meals is $135 a person. (Rates given are a person in double occupancy during regular season, including tax and sevice, except where noted. Ski weeks begin Sunday nights and many weekend packages are available.) A six-night package with meals at the more modest Auberge Mont Gabriel (514-229-3547) is $285 to $350 a person. Gray Rocks Inn (819-425-2771) in St. Jovite emphasizes learn-to-ski weeks. A turreted Victorian mansion and its annexes can accommodate up to 550 guests. Lodging ranges from rooms with shared baths to deluxe with fireplaces. Rates of $400 to $635 a person include six nights, three meals daily, seven days of skiing at Gray Rocks' own hill, 22 hours of instruction and access to cross-country trails, a health club and indoor pool. Condominiums offer good value, particularly for groups of four or more. An example is Village Mont St. Sauveur (514-227-4671) at the base of the ski hill. For five nights, a two-bedroom apartment rents for $320 for two people, $400 for four and, using the living room, $490 for six. Baby-sitting is available, and a 22 percent discount is offered on lift tickets at Mont St. Sauveur, just outside the door. A five-night, six-day package with lessons and day or night skiing is $270 a person without meals. The deluxe Auberge St. Denis (514-227-4766), a small lodge a quarter-mile from Mont St. Sauveur is known for its French cuisine.

Hotel packages with meals are available also for cross-country skiers.

Marguerite, a 100-room lodge with chalets, five nights cost $215 to $242.

Mont Tremblant has its own reservations office (819-425-8681). Where to Dine Le St. Trop (514-229-3298) in Ste. Adele set the standard for haute cuisine in the Laurentians six years ago. Much of the produce is imported, but concessions are made to Quebec with local foie gras, fresh salmon and lamb. Dinner for two is about $70, plus wine.

For Nonskiers Armand Bombardier, a Quebecer, gave the world a brand-new sport in 1936 with his snowmobile, first used by a priest traveling a rural parish. Ste. Agathe's Club Moto-Neige, founded in 1963, was the world's first and today 2,000 miles of trails link Laurentian towns and connect with routes to Quebec City, 240 miles, or two days, away.
