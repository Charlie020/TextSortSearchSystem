567|1987\01\03|Slow and Fast Solutions on Teen-Age Pregnancy|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: It took a 15-member expert panel of the National Research Council two years and 337 pages to come to the empty conclusion that ''we currently know very little about how to effectively discourage unmarried teen-agers from initiating intercourse.'' Based on their inability to arrive at a more suitable solution, their recommendation was to provide teen-agers with low-cost contraceptives. This is my solution, and it will take only two seconds and three words to relate it: ''Thou shalt not!'' Or, in the words of St. Paul: ''Flee youthful lusts'' (II Timothy 2:22). To supply teen-agers with an easy exit is to spell failure from the start. Teen-agers need to feel that parents have a sense of confidence in their integrity. If they feel they are expected to engage in sex before marriage, they probably will. DIANE DEW Milwaukee, Dec. 11, 1986
