The Vons Companies said today that it had agreed to merge with Allied Supermarkets Inc., then sell Allied's Michigan operations to a management-led group. The merger turns Vons, a privately held supermarket concern based in El Monte, Calif., into a public company because Vons inherits the corporate and financial structure of Allied, whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal also means that Allied will be taken private. Its directors agreed to sell the company's Michigan stores, which comprise essentially all of its retail and wholesale outlets, to members of management for $46 million in cash and debt. The new owners would also assume more than $20 million in liabilities. Vons shareholders will receive $132.1 million in cash and 13.3 million shares of Allied common stock. Allied has 23 supermarkets and annual revenues of about $386 million. Vons operates 190 stores under several names in California and Nevada and has annual revenues of nearly $3 billion. COMPANY NEWS
