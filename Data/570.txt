Also signed was the defender, Andranik Eskandarian, a former member of the Cosmos. The acquisition of the new players comes four days after Shep Messing, the Express president and goalkeeper, said that Don Popovic would be named the new coach to replace Ray Klivecka, who was dismissed Dec. 23. However, Popovic, the former coach of the New York Arrows, will be unable to take the job until he clears up his contractual problems with the defunct Pittsburgh Spirits. SPORTS PEOPLE
