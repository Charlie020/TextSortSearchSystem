Two of the long-distance competitors of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company say they will respond later this month to the 11.2 percent rate cut A.T.& T. put in place today. A.T.& T. delivered its revised price package to the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday, too late for MCI and US Sprint to prepare responses. ''We intend to remain the price leader in the industry,'' Charles Skibo, the president of US Sprint Communications Co., said Wednesday in New York. He said the company would announce price decreases soon. MCI said it, too, would draw up new rates.
