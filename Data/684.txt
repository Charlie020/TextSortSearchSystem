To the Editor:  ''A Grueling Struggle for Equality'' (Nov. 9) did not have to make use of 1961 classified ads to illustrate the 1960 survey statement, ''Whatever their work skills, less attractive women were rejected - even in the classified ads.'' While one might wonder what 30 percent of 2,000 companies would say in 1986, a review of the classifieds in the Sunday New York Times on Nov. 9 illustrated that descriptors such as ''attractive,'' ''bright and perky,'' and ''modeling a plus'' are still included in ads for pink collar fields such as receptionist and administrative titles. Descriptors for male-dominated fields, such as messenger, are primarily job performance related rather than subjective. The perception of pink collar jobs in sexual rather than functional terms is apparent in such ads as ''Word Processor With a Brain.'' The majority of word processors are female; the classified ad reflects a recruitment effort for other than the perceived norm. Were I to compose a classified ad for ''messenger'' in the tone used for pink collar occupations, I might say something like ''Clean-shaven, fresh-smelling, polite, energetic champ with good leg muscles, and a winning smile.''
