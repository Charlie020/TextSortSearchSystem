222|1987\01\01|Was It Just a Scheme To Pay for the Contras?|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North has perhaps wisely chosen to place his trust in the Lord (news story, Dec. 19), just as the currency of the nation suggests. He quotes Psalm 7: ''O Lord my God, in Thee do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me, lest like a lion they rend me, dragging me away with none to rescue.'' So far, so good. The verse immediately following, however, continues: ''O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is any wrong in my hands, if I have requited my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause, let the enemy pursue me and overtake me, and let him trample my life to the ground and lay my soul in the dust.'' Usually it is good advice to read less selectively and more completely if one chooses to quote the Bible; it has an uncanny capacity to zap the quoter. JEAN S. BERG  St. Louis, Dec. 19, 1986
