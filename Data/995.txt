995|1987\01\04|'The Common Good'|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: Peter Steinfels' review of Marcus G. Raskin's book ''The Common Good'' (Nov. 23) entirely missed the point. His major complaint - that Mr. Raskin failed to address possible ''ideologically conservaVive'' challenges to his proposals - ignored the fact that Mr. Raskin has developed a set of concrete alternatives for a more just and democratic America. Mr. Raskin's proposals offer a vision and a hope in a period when young people like myself are questioning what democracy is all about.  KATHERINE ROBERTS  New York
