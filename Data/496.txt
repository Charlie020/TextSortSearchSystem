Chile's military Government announced today that it was lifting a two-year-old nighttime curfew in Santiago, the latest in a series of steps designed to improve the country's image abroad. Two days ago President Augusto Pinochet announced that a state of siege in effect since September would expire next week. He also announced that the Government would permit most of Chile's several thousand political exiles to return home over the next 90 days. In a brief announcement today, the security authorities said the curfew was being suspended with immediate effect in Santiago and the coastal province of San Antonio, the only regions in which it was still being applied. The curfew, between 2 A.M. and 5 A.M., had been in force since November 1984.
