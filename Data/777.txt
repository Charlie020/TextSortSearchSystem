To the Editor: Your article on Nov. 30 headlined ''Manhattan Hotels Break the $200 Barrier'' paints a totally inaccurate picture of actual hotel rates in the city. The rates discussed in the article are those that may be charged in a few of the 130 Manhattan hotels. The erroneous impression is thus created that ''there is no room at the inn'' for someone who cannot afford $200 a night. In New York, each hotel determines its own rate, and the rates are competitive with those in other cities. In most hotels in New York City the average rate per night is substantially below the figures quoted. In fact, the average nightly rate citywide, exclusive of taxes, is below $100. The traveling public should know that New York hotels, because of their diversity, are able to remain competitive with hotels in other cities bidding for tourists and conventions. ALBERT A. FORMICOLA  The writer is president of the Hotel Association of New York City.
