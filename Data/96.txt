Sales Ban Appeal|A New York State appeals court ruled yesterday that the New York Agriculture Commissioner acted properly in denying a New Jersey dairy access to Long Island markets.|A New York State appeals court ruled yesterday that the New York Agriculture Commissioner acted properly in denying a New Jersey dairy access to Long Island markets. A New York State appeals court ruled yesterday that the New York Agriculture Commissioner acted properly in denying a New Jersey dairy access to Long Island markets. In a unanimous ruling, a five-member panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled that the Commissioner, Joseph Gerace, correctly decided under New York's milk-licensing laws that letting Farmland Dairies sell milk in Nassau and Suffolk Counties would ''have the potential for disrupting the market's balanced distribution structure.'' The ruling, written by Justice Robert Main, continues the consistent support the state's controversial milk-licensing system has enjoyed in court. Farmland, based in Wallington, N.J., has challenged that system by trying to get into the lucrative New York City-area markets. It has won the right to sell milk on Staten Island, but its request to expand into the other boroughs was rejected by Mr. Gerace on Dec. 11. METRO DATELINES
