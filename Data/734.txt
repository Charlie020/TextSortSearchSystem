The eligibility of college freshmen to compete in varsity athletics should be revoked. The freshmen eligibility rule has been profitable for the colleges and their fans. However the interests of the student-athlete must take precedence over the interests of the colleges and their fans. The transition from high school student to college student is traumatic at best, but for the student-athlete the effect of this change is magnified. The star high school athlete has reached a level of prominence that few people attain. In college most of these stars receive considerably less attention, and this can make the transition even more traumatic. The pressures of competition in varsity athletics should be delayed until the sophomore year to allow the student-athletes time to adjust to their new scholastic challenges as well as the challenges of maturing, living away from home and adjusting to college life.
