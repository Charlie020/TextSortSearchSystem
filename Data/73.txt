The Pullman-Peabody Company said today that it had dropped its unsolicited bid to acquire the Joy Manufacturing Company, which has agreed instead to be purchased by an investor group for $35 a share, or $620 million. Pullman-Peabody had started a $31-a-share tender offer for Joy on Dec. 2, and later proposed to sweeten the bid to $34 a share. But Joy rejected both offers as inadequate and accepted the investor group's bid on Dec. 22. Under its agreement with Joy, Pullman-Peabody said it would tender the nearly one million Joy common shares it already owned to the investor group, which was formed by Adler & Shaykin, a New York investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts. The agreement also calls for litigation between the companies to be dropped, and for Joy to pay $750,000 to Pullman-Peabody to help cover Pullman-Peabody's expenses in connection with its failed offer. Pittsburgh-based Joy is a maker of oilfield and petroleum equipment and coal-mining machinery. Pullman-Peabody, based in Princeton, supplies material-handling and food service equipment, and makes components for the aerospace and communications industries. The investor group's tender offer for Joy's stock is due to expire Jan. 26. Joy's stock closed at $34.75 a share today, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange trading. COMPANY NEWS
