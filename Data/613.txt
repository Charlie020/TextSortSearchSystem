Elton John, who had throat problems on his recent rock tour here, will have throat surgery and has canceled all 1987 performances, including a United States tour, his publicist said today. The publicist, Patti Mostyn, said the 39-year-old British singer would enter a private Australian hospital Monday for the operation and was expected to remain in the hospital three or four days. ''The surgery is exploratory only,'' Ms Mostyn said. No details of the operation have been released, and Ms. Mostyn said Mr. John had asked that the hospital's identity be kept secret. The entertainer canceled one concert in Perth last month and collapsed on stage during a concert in Sydney toward the end of a 27-date tour. Ms. Mostyn said Mr. John would give no concerts in 1987. He had been scheduled to return to the United States next month for 32 concerts.
