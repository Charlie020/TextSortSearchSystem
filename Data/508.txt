Afghan guerrilla leaders today rejected the cease-fire proposal of the Afghan leader and called the plan ''a sham.'' The Afghan leader, Najib, announced Thursday that the Government would observe a truce beginning Jan. 15. The official Soviet press agency, Tass, said Kabul had made the offer in the hope of opening discussions with the guerrillas, who have been fighting the Marxist Government since April 1978. In Pakistan, where the guerrillas are based, Mohammed Nabi Mohammedi, who heads the Movement for Islamic Revolution in Afghanistan, said in a statement: ''The cease-fire offer is not acceptable to us. It is a sham and a deception.'' Gulbaddin Hikmatyar, president of the Islamic Front guerrilla group, also rejected the truce offer.
