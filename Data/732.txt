A ''Marshall swindle'' or just plain ''swindle'' is not a kind of cheating or a contravening of the rules of the game. The word connotes a diabolically clever move or combination that turns the tables on the opponent. Frank Marshall often played a game in a lazy or relaxed style that ceded his opponent the advantage. Yet, counter to expectation, the United States champion from 1909 to 1936 didn't lose all of these. Just when he appeared to be in a totally lost position, he would summon up a marvelous tactical flight of fancy to smash his unaware opponent. Some of his defeated and frustrated opponents, believing that they had a moral right to the victory after having established decisive advantage, felt that Marshall had cheated them out of their just deserts. They - an often enraged David Janowski led these unfortunates - pitifully screamed that they had been swindled. But, as Yogi Berra has trenchantly observed, ''The game isn't over 'til it's over.'' On the current American scene, the player who best wears the mantle of Marshall is Kamran Shirazi, a 34-year-old Beverly Hills international master originally from Iran. In the 1986 United States championship, Shirazi was awarded the Craig Crenshaw prize for the best swindle for his ninth-round game against Grandmaster Nick DeFirmian of Oakland, Calif. It was probably coincidental that Shirazi chose the Petrov Defense, but this nevertheless was a great favorite of Marshall. Moreover, instead of the modern method of development with 6 ... B-K2 or 6 ... N-QB3, Shirazi reverted to Marshall's old 6 ... B-Q3, which had long been under a cloud but is now being looked into again. Years ago the late Paul Keres recommended 9 Q-B2 but the truth is that the gambit with 9 ... N-R3!; 10 BxN, PxB; 11 QxP, R-K1 yields Black a powerful initiative. This game was copying one played by Bozidar Ivanovic and Alexander Khalifman in last year's Plovdiv, Bulgaria, International Tournament up to the point where Ivanovic retreated with 13 B-K2. DeFirmian diverged with the superior 13 B-Q3. After 13 ... N-Q2; 14 P-KR3, B-R4; 15 B-K4, Shirazi should have played 15 ... R-B1; 16 P-QR4, P-QR3; 17 Q-Q3, B-N3, with only a slight superiority for White. Instead, he carelessly played 15 ... Q-B2? (Marshall occasionally nodded, too) and was struck by 16 BxPch! Since 16 ... KxB; 17 N-N5ch, K-N3; 18 P-N4 is very strong for White, Shirazi had to acquiesce in the loss of a pawn with 16 ... K-R1. Before Black could get an attack going, DeFirmian forced a relaxation of the tension with 20 N-N5! The upshot, after 25 ... B-Q3, was that Shirazi was a pawn down with nothing to show for it. After 26 QxKP, he could not play 26 ... RxP?, which would have allowed 27 Q-R4ch. And since there was no chance to save the game by mincing play, he threw everything, with 26 ... Q-B2, into the sort of wide-open tactical game that Marshall loved. After 27 QxP, Q-N3, DeFirmian's objective was to consolidate his great material advantage. He could have accomplished this with 28 R-N2! because 28 ... R-K1 can be answered by 29 B-Q2!, but not by 29 B-K3?!, RxB!; 30 PxR, Q-N6!, which forces White to take perpetual check with 31 Q-K8ch, K-R2; 32 Q-R5ch, K-N1; 33 Q-K8ch, and so on. Instead, he played 28 RxP? and permitted 28 ... RxP. He thought to bail out with 29 Q-R8ch, R-B1; 30 R-N5, but Shirazi unleashed the marvelous Marshall masher, 30 ... Q-K5!, and the game was over. Since 31 QxQ allows 31 ... R-B8mate, DeFirmian gave up. CHESS
