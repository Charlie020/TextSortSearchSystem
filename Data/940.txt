(Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) ZEN EFFECTS: The Life of Alan Watts. By Monica Furlong. (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) Alan Watts began his career by learning about Zen Buddhism in order to write a book about it. He wound up guiding American tourists around Japan. In between lay four decades of spiritual entrepreneurship that - to take the generous view -brought him more celebrity than peace. Watts (1915-73) declared himself a Buddhist while attending the public school attached to Canterbury Cathedral; he lost a chance at Oxford by answering a scholarship examination in the style of Nietzsche. Arrogance, provocation and self-destruction remained characteristic. Having emigrated and become an Episcopal priest, he proved a popular and energetic chaplain at Northwestern University - until he persuaded the first of his three wives to join him in a menage a quatre. After 1951 he lived in or around San Francisco, writing, broadcasting and attracting first the Beats, then the flower children. What was Watts's message? From mysticism without tears - you are part of the infinite, don't sweat meditation or self-discipline - it came to include praise of hallucinogens and even tips on diet. Monica Furlong makes a good case for her subject's rueful, if fitful, self-awareness. She is less convincing on the charm often claimed for the type she calls the ''rascal-guru'' - we glimpse it only as Watts trains the mockingbirds in his California backyard to sing like English nightingales.
