To the Editor:  Texas Instruments was commented on erroneously in Robert Reich's obituary for the United States semiconductor industry (''Making a Rust Bowl of Silicon Valley,'' Forum, Oct. 12). The article said that T.I. has ''already begun to move their production of memory chips to their better equipped Japanese subsidiaries.'' T.I. has in fact deepened its commitment to its United States semiconductor operations with a state-of-the-art DRAM (dynamic random access memory) wafer fabrication facility in Dallas. That wafer-fab was begun two years ago as part of the company's strategy to have a strong memory operation in the United States, capable of producing present- and future-generation semiconductor memories. We are now manufacturing high-density MOS memory products in the United States at yields on a par with the best in Japan. Furthermore, T.I.'s plant in Lubbock, Tex., is in high-volume production on EPROM's, another type of memory chip which has also experienced Japanese dumping. In the fourth quarter of 1986, a substantial share of our total worldwide semiconductor memory production came from these two United States-based plants.  NORMAN P. NEUREITER Vice President, Texas Instruments Dallas, Nov. 17
