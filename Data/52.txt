Singapore's economic growth rate is beginning to improve, but still needs wage restraint to return to full health, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in a year-end message today. The real growth rate after inflation in 1987 is expected to be between 3 and 4 percent, compared with 1.9 percent projected for this year, he said. In 1985, the economy shrank nearly 2 percent, after growing 8.2 percent a year earlier. The Prime Minister said manufacturing was beginning to pick up, but commerce, banking and building activity were still depressed. Despite holding down wage increases, Singapore had still not recovered its competitiveness against countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. ''We need at least one more year of high-productivity growth and wage restraint to close the gap,'' he said.
