But then, he knew he would be in office only for the weekend. Lieut. Gov. John Wayne Mixson, sworn in today as Florida's 39th Governor, entered office with a brief agenda. But then, he knew he would be in office only for the weekend. Mr. Mixson, a 64-year-old cattle rancher, succeeded Gov. Bob Graham, a Democrat who resigned three days early to become the state's junior United States Senator at noon today. Mr. Mixson recited the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice Parker Lee McDonald of the Florida Supreme Court, before about 300 well-wishers in the State House of Representatives. Among those present were Mr. Graham and Governor-elect Bob Martinez, a Republican, who is to be sworn in Tuesday as Florida's 40th Governor. The new Governor's three-day administration will mark the pinnacle as well as the end of his political career. Mr. Mixson, a Democrat and former State Representative, plans to retire after 20 years of elective office when Mr. Martinez is sworn in. Mr. Mixson planned a weekend administration of mostly appointments and ceremonies and a few necessary details of government. The new Governor declined even to say whether he would appoint a Lieutenant Governor. ''I have not made any decision, which is probably a good clue to the ultimate disposition of that subject matter,'' he said, adding that, contrary to Statehouse gossip, his wife, Margie, would not be appointed.
