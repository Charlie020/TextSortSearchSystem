937|1987\01\04|The I.B.M. Theory|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: Susan Kinsley's review of Richard Thomas DeLamarter's ''Big Blue: IBM's Use and Abuse of Power'' (Nov. 23) does the book a great injustice. She dismisses it on the sole ground of a ''tediously detailed presentation.'' I wonder what she'd have thought of Darwin's ''Origin of Species.'' The book puts forward the thesis (which your reviewer ignores) that I.B.M. is an insatiable monopoly that will not stop devouring competitors until it completely controls the flow of information in the whole world. Mr. DeLamarter contradicts received opinion on his subject, and that necessarily makes for lots of proof. His theory of I.B.M. monopolism may not be very entertaining, but it wasn't meant to be. Your readers deserved a better review.  BEN ROSS SCHNEIDER JR.  Appleton, Wis.
