The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday as trading continued light following the New Year's Day holiday. Gold prices were also mixed. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted its final bid of the day at $401.25 an ounce, down $2.75 from Wednesday. Markets were closed Thursday for the holiday and ended early yesterday. James Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said most of the dollar's movement was caused by traders adjusting their positions rather than any economic news. Commerce Department reports that construction spending fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in November and factory orders rose 4.1 percent the same month had little effect, Mr. Vick said. Trading continued thin, meaning the few transactions that took place had an exaggerated impact on the market, he said. In Europe, dealers said that Wednesday's announcement of a record $19.2 billion monthly trade deficit continued to pull the dollar downward yesterday, but little else affected the extremely quiet trading there. Most traders were expected to be back in the market on Monday. The West German central bank did not actively intervene to support the dollar, dealers said. A stronger dollar makes West Germany's United States exports more expensive. In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.9165 West German marks, down from 1.9250 late Wednesday. In New York later, the dollar closed at 1.9240 marks, up from 1.91975 Wednesday. The pound rose again on the strength of optimistic forecasts for the British economy and higher British oil prices. Britain is the world's fifth-largest oil producer. In London, it cost $1.4925 to buy one pound, more than $1.4820 late Wednesday, and in New York, sterling rose to $1.4890 from $1.4845. Tokyo foreign exchange markets were closed yesterday. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in London, to 158.15 yen, from 160.10 on Wednesday. In later New York trading, the dollar closed at 158.475 yen, up from 158.05 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday, were: 1.6070 Swiss francs, down from 1.6110; 6.3550 French francs, down from 6.3825; 2.1670 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1720; 1,337.25 Italian lire, down from 1,343.00, and 1.3787 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3805. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 6.3575 French francs, down from 6.3620; 1.61525 Swiss francs, up from 1.6090; 1,338.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.3782 Canadian dollars, down from 1.38045. Gold climbed overseas on the basis of stronger oil prices and the weaker dollar, traders said. Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $403.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $390.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $11.90 to close at a bid $402.99 an ounce. Later, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold cost $401.90, down from Wednesday's close of $404.90 The gold market in Zurich was closed again yesterday. Gold closed at $389 an ounce there late Wednesday. CURRENCY MARKETS
