McFarland of Nevada as the new Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. Pope John Paul II has named Bishop Norman F. McFarland of Nevada as the new Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. Bishop McFarland, 64 years old, who has headed the Reno-Las Vegas Diocese for 10 years, succeeds Bishop William R. Johnson, who died July 28. He was the first Bishop of Orange, the second-largest diocese in California, serving 500,000 Catholics. The Pope also named three Auxiliary Bishops for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on Monday. They are the Rev. Patrick Ziemann, 45, of Los Angeles; the Rev. Armando Ochoa, 43, of Los Angeles, and the Rev. P. Carl Fisher, 41, of Baltimore. Father Fisher's appointment makes him the first black Bishop in the Western United States. Archbishop Roger Mahony said he had asked the Pope to appoint a black Auxiliary Bishop ''because Los Angeles has the third-highest overall black population among all the dioceses and archdioceses of the United States.'' The archdiocese estimates that a million blacks live in its boundaries, about 50,000 of them Catholic.
