A partly clothed woman with her hands tied behind her back was apparently pushed to her death yesterday from a window in a midtown hotel, the police said. The unidentified woman, in her 20's, was discovered at 5:40 A.M. in the rear courtyard of the Carter Hotel, one block west of Times Square, said Officer Edward Kulesa. Homicide detectives investigating the case had not been able to locate any witnesses, but several guests reported hearing loud arguments in room 1604, which was later found to be in disarray, said Officer James Coleman, another police spokesman. Neither the police nor the hotel would disclose who had checked into that room.
