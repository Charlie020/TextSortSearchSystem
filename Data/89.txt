89|1987\01\01|Macy's Stores To Open Today|For what is believed to be the first time in the company's 128 years, Macy's stores nationwide will be open New Year's Day.|For what is believed to be the first time in the company's 128 years, Macy's stores nationwide will be open New Year's Day. For what is believed to be the first time in the company's 128 years, Macy's stores nationwide will be open New Year's Day. Judith Cohen, a spokesman for the store, said executives would be looking at the experiment ''very carefully'' this year to determine whether it would become a permanent policy. The decision to open the stores was based on the assumption that potential shoppers would be grateful for a place to go during the holiday. ''We're open most holidays and sales are good,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''Management figured that New Year's Day would be the same.'' Several months ago, employees were given the option of working New Year's, with additional pay or compensatory time as an incentive. ''No employee had to work who didn't want to,'' Ms. Cohen said. She said she did not know how many employees had agreed to work, but added that it was ''enough to keep the store open.'' The city's other major department stores - including Saks, Bloomingdale's and Bergdorf Goodman - will all be closed New Year's Day. Macy's will have shortened hours, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.
