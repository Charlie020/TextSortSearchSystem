A Cherry Hill man must share a $327,296 slot machine jackpot with a longtime friend from Atlantic County because the two pooled their quarters to gamble, an appeals court has ruled. A panel of three judges in the Superior Court's Appellate Division this week upheld a lower court ruling granting one-half the jackpot to Karen Quitmeyer of Brigantine, who had filed suit against Dale Henhaffer to obtain the money. ''The facts presented to the jury bespeak a common enterprise under which the parties operated the slot machines and accumulated the winnings in a common pool,'' the court said. According to trial testimony, Ms. Quitmeyer was playing three slot machines with a friend Feb. 4, 1984, letting the winnings accumulate in the machine tills. When Ms. Quitmeyer's boyfriend and Mr. Henhaffer approached, all four began to play with the accumulated winnings. Ms. Quitmeyer then left the immediate area to arrange a complimentary breakfast for the group, taking no money with her. Several minutes later she heard a commotion by the slot machines and learned that Mr. Henhaffer had won the large jackpot. Mr. Henhaffer told the jury he was not using Ms. Quitmeyer's coins because he had purchased a $10 roll of quarters and had received 13 coins from his wife. Ms. Quitmeyer filed suit when Mr. Henhaffer refused to acknowledge she was entitled to any money.
