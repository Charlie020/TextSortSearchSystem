We think freshmen athletes, both men and women, should not be eligible for intercollegiate competition. Based on interviews with a systematic random sample of 227 students (about 11 percent of the student population) at a private liberal-arts college about a variety of topics (including topics that have no relation to athletics), 21 percent of freshmen athletes reported grade-point averages below 2.0, while only 5 percent of freshmen nonathletes reported grade-point averages below 2.0. This means an athlete is four times more likely than a nonathlete to finish his or her first year of college in academic difficulty. In contrast, no athletes beyond the first year of college reported a grade-point average below 2.0. These findings, along with others beyond the scope of this short letter, lead us to think that colleges are doing freshmen a disservice by encouraging these young people to put their college careers at risk when a likely reward for athletic participation is academic probation. We should emphasize that this survey was conducted at an institution that places its priorities on academics. We could well assume that the situation is worse at institutions that place a major emphasis on athletics. CAROL J.
