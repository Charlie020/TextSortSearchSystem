999|1987\01\04|Special Education|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: Jane Perlez's review of ''The Magic Feather: The Truth About 'Special Education' '' by Lori Granger and Bill Granger (Dec. 7) states that this book ''should prove a useful resource to parents.'' Certainly its exposure of the misdiagnosis and misplacement of special education students, its critique of intelligence testing and its documentation of the use of special education classes to resegregate black students deserve a careful reading. However, the Grangers' book comes close to arguing that emotional and learning disabilities are fictions spread by therapists, teachers and educational bureaucrats looking for an easy ride at public expense. Specialized education for all but the most severely disabled is therefore not only a waste, but virtually a crime. My wife and I spend many hours each week struggling with the educational system to get our 5-year-old son, whom we know to have special needs, the education that we know can help him -and that he has a right to. Despite its strengths, this book is going to make things harder for us. ''The Magic Feather'' and Jane Perlez's unbalanced review give justification to austerity-minded bureaucrats and neoconservative ideologues who are more interested in real estate development than human development.
