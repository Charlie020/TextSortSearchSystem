Fiscal mismanagement, health and security risks and staff shortages are widespread in the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles, according to a report by the Office of the State Auditor. ''There is a lack of assurance that records are accurately maintained, that transactions are properly entered into the system and that all revenues are collected and remitted to the state,'' the 17-page report said. Spokesmen for the Attorney General's office, which oversees the department, could not be reached for comment. But in a formal response contained in the report, Attorney General W. Cary Edwards and the department director, Glenn Paulsen, wrote they are making progress to correct the problems. The department has been criticized in the past because of long lines at its offices, computer malfunctions, paperwork backlogs and impolite workers. The auditor's report found that the agency failed to reconcile its revenue documents with those of the Treasury Department, update inventory records and deposit cash receipts in a timely manner. Because of staff shortages, the report said, the department failed to complete required field audits and has ''haphazardly'' stored certain documents. METRO DATELINES
