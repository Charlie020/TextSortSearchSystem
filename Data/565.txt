565|1987\01\03|He Couldn't Win|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: Your Dec. 9 editorial is properly in favor of competitive bidding for National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other Government contracts. You are, however, out of line in suggesting that the award to Thiokol was because of political and regional favoritism by James C. Fletcher. Dr. Fletcher has a long record of association with the losing bidder, Aerojet General. He is a former vice president of Aerojet, and was president of its Space General division prior to becoming president of the University of Utah in 1968. No matter which way the decision went, Dr. Fletcher was sure to be charged with favoritism because he also is a former resident of Utah, but is not a native, and has not lived there since 1972. I think you were taken in by the partisan rhetoric of Senators William Proxmire, Albert Gore and Ernest Hollings. GEORGE S. ODIORNE St. Petersburg, Fla., Dec. 9, 1986
