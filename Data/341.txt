The transit police are investigating how a man with a fractured skull came to be lying on the subway tracks of a Queens station, a spokesman said yesterday. The man, Dave Webb, 26 years old, of 130-32 Laurelton Parkway in the Rosedale section, was taken to the Queens Hospital Center, where he was listed in critical condition yesterday, said Elaine Likari, a hospital administrator. A flagman at the 179th Street Station at Hillside Avenue saw Mr. Webb lying on the road bed at about 5:15 A.M. and tried to warn an incoming E train that he was there, Mr. Cunningham said. Although the train was able to slow down, one car passed over him without striking him, he said. ''We have not been able to determine how he sustained his injuries, whether he was hit by a previous train or involved in an altercation,'' said a Transit Authority spokesman, John Cunningham. In addition to the fractured skull, the victim also had a broken arm and lacerations, he said. METRO DATELINES
