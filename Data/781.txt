But his realism is a dead option if it requires, as he says, ''seeing the world as it is.'' Leon Wieseltier proposes tough-minded realism as the antidote to Reaganite idealism, as if realism and idealism were the only options available in foreign policy. But his realism is a dead option if it requires, as he says, ''seeing the world as it is.'' I suggest that nobody sees the world as it is, though everyone mistakenly believes that he does. Is Mr. Wieseltier seeing the world as it is when he suggests that to abolish nuclear weapons is to abolish ''the security of Europe''? How does he know this? I propose, against both realism and idealism, a skepticism that tells us that we know very little about the future and are poor predictors of the consequences of our policies. But does it follow that we must give up ideals altogether? Not at all. There is room for an idealism that consists, not in the pursuit of future dreams, but in a passionate commitment to fairness and honesty in the present. This is quite a bit more inspiring than a realism that reduces morality to unsubstantiated guesses about political American interests.  DOUGLAS P. $:ACKEY  New York City
