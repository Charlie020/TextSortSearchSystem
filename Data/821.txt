The Emigrant Savings Bank, the nation's 18th largest savings bank and once one of New York's most prominent housing lenders, was sold last week to Seymour and Paul Milstein, New York real-estate developers. There was no answer yesterday at the banks headquarters in Manhattan or at the offices of Milstein Properties. David Halvorsen, the lawyer for the New York State Banking Department, which approved the sale, said the Milsteins agreed to provide $90 million in fresh capital to Emigrant. There was no additional purchase price, he said. Although Emigrant, like other savings banks, lost large amounts of money in the early 1980's because of high interest rates and limits on what it could charge for loans, the bank was profitable of late. It earned about $26 million in the first 11 months of 1986. Still, according to Mr. Halvorsen, selling the bank was difficult. The sale of Emigrant follows by less than two weeks the sale of another major New York savings bank. The Williamsburgh Savings Bank was sold to the Republic National Bank of New York for about $85 million. In recent years, several troubled savings banks have been sold to private investors. These have included the Bowery Savings Bank and the East River Savings Bank. Although it is unusual for a savings institution to be sold to real-estate developers, it has happened before. State and Federal banking laws are aimed at preventing conflicts of interest in these cases. Emigrant was founded in the 1850's to provide loans to Irish immigrants.
