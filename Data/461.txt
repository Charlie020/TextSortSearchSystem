Visitors to the Statue of Liberty will have to pay a $1 entry fee beginning in February, the National Park Service has announced. ''Up until now, the only thing they've ever had to pay was the Circle Line for the ferry to the statue,'' said a park service spokesman, Carol Scott. The round-trip ferry ride is $3.95. The fee is due to expire in September 1987. The new fee schedule, put into effect at select parks around the country, is intended to repay a $15 million loan the Federal Government made to the National Park Service to pay for the rehabilitation of recreation areas. The only other park in the New York metropolitan region affected by the new fee schedule is Theodore Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay, L.I., where admission will be increased 50 cents, to $1.
