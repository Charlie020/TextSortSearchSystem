The Canadian Government has opened a new major market of mortgage-backed securities, modeled after the hugely successful program in the United States. Analysts expect the value of the market to exceed $250 million (Canadian), or $180 million (United States), by the end of 1987 and then grow dramatically in 1988 and 1989. Market watchers, however, said the market would initially suffer teething problems because of the complex nature and novelty of the investment instruments. ''The U.S. mortgage-backed securities market is probably the most innovative yet complex securities market in the world,'' said James Stevens, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. The Canadian Government, looking to increase funds available for mortgages and spark a revival in long-term mortgages, will guarantee repayment of the securities for investors. Mr. Stevens noted that the new securities have the growth potential of mortgage-backed securities sold in the United States by the Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal National Mortgage Association. Initially, he added, the new securities will attract the smaller investor, but once larger issues with longer terms are offered, the big institutions will become involved. Because the securities are exempt from Canadian withholding taxes, there is expected to be considerable foreign interest. Foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, are playing an increasingly large role in the Canadian bond market.
