910|1987\01\04|Yanks Lose Out|To the Sports Editor:|To the Sports Editor: To the Sports Editor: Why didn't someone tell George Steinbrenner that with the addition of Rick Rhoden, a possible 20-game winner, to the rest of the Yankees' pitching staff (which had a year to be proud of), Reggie Jackson would have been a valuable addition to the October pennant race? The Yankee bullpen is already a force to be reckoned with, and the starters are on their way to a successful season. But a team can never have enough power hitters. The Yankees definitely do not lack in power, but with the runs that must be scored late in the season, Mr. October could have helped take them to the pennant. NICHOLAS T. SCHARLATT Bronx
