316|1987\01\02|3 OF 100 MALES IN CORRECTION SYSTEM, U.S. SAYS|Three of every 100 adult males in the United States were incarcerated or under some other correctional supervision at the end of 1985, according to a Justice Department report released today.|Three of every 100 adult males in the United States were incarcerated or under some other correctional supervision at the end of 1985, according to a Justice Department report released today. Three of every 100 adult males in the United States were incarcerated or under some other correctional supervision at the end of 1985, according to a Justice Department report released today. The report also said that at the end of 1985 nearly three million men and women were under some form of correctional supervision - imprisoned, on probation or on parole. The total number of adults under supervision increased by nearly 200,000 people, or 17 percent, from 1983 to 1985, according to the report, ''Probation and Parole, 1985.'' The 2.9 million adults under supervision made up 1.67 percent of the total adult population, or 1 out of every 61 adults in the United States, according to the report, which was released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a branch of the Justice Department. Most Were on Probation Of those under any form of supervision, 64.4 percent were on probation, 17.3 percent were in prison, 8.7 percent were in jail and 9.6 percent were on parole, the report said. This means that about three-fourths of the adults under supervision at the end of 1985 were in the community, with the 26 percent remaining incarcerated, according to the report. The report noted that in the last two years the number of adults placed on probation rose faster than the number who were imprisoned. The probation population rose 18 percent, to reach a record of 1.9 million adults, while the number of people incarcerated rose 15 percent, to 750,000 adults. Stu Smith, a spokesman, said the bureau could not determine whether the disparity between the incarceration and probation figures meant that more people were committing minor crimes or that judges were less likely than in the past to sentence defendants to prison. He said that available prison space had decreased in recent years. Statistics were compiled by state, with 43 states reporting increased probation populations in 1985. The report also noted that of the 2.9 million adults under correctional supervision, nearly 87 percent were male; 65 percent were white, 34 percent were black, and 1 percent were of other races.
