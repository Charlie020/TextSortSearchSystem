''ALTHOUGH we have explored three billion miles in outer space, we know very little about the eight miles beneath our feet,'' the sponsor of a conference on the earth's crust told 120 scientists at the University of Illinois. Out of the conference, held in Champaign last April, came a proposal to drill a hole six miles deep in southeastern Illinois. Scientists said it would take them back 600 million years in geologic time and could help in oil exploration, mineral and rare earth discoveries, the burial of hazardous waste, understanding of earthquakes and the monitoring of nuclear tests. The proposal is one of four under scientific evaluation, says the sponsor of the conference, a nonprofit corporation in Washington called Deep Observation and Sampling of the Earth's Continental Crust Inc. - or Dosecc, as it calls itself. It is a consortium of 35 colleges and universities, including Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Penn State, Yale and Brown. A geophysicist and senior operations officer of the group, Robert Andrews, says the other suggested sites for holes - all 30,000 to 50,000 feet deep - are in the southern Appalachian Mountains near southwest South Carolina, along the Texas Gulf Coast and on the island of Hawaii. A decision on which holes to drill and in what order will be made by the middle of this year, he says. FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS
