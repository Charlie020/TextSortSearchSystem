Chadian sources said today that Government troops had captured Fada, a key Libyan base in northeastern Chad, after heavy fighting. The report could not be confirmed independently. Libya said its troops were not involved in the fighting, which it said was between two groups of Chadian rebels. A capture of Fada, occupied by Libya for three years, could open the way for a push on Faya-Largeau, Libya's largest stronghold in northern Chad. Libyan troops have also occupied Faya-Largeau, about 175 miles northwest of Fada, for the last three years. The fighting at Fada appeared to signal the opening of a second front, southeast of Faya-Largeau, in a bid by President Hissen Habre to retake the north alongside former rebels who controlled the area with Libyan backing until breaking with Libya in October. Ten days ago, a column of Mr. Habre's troops left Ndjamena to join forces with the former rebels, who are loyal to former President Goukouni Oueddei. Only hours before the reports about fighting at Fada, Chad said its troops had recaptured Zouar, a key oasis town in the northwestern Tibesti mountain range, after heavy fighting against Libyan forces that seized it on Sunday from the rebels, their former allies.
