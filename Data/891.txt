AFTER two years as the Philadelphia 76ers' general manager, Jack Ramsay, who had coached St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia for 11 seasons, decided to take a crack at coaching in the National Basketball Association. He has been at it ever since and four different teams have rolled to victories under his guidance. But one of his most memorable regular-season successes came Friday night in Indianapolis when the Indiana Pacers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 116-106. It was Ramsay's 800th career victory. Only Red Auerbach accumulated more victories in the N.B.A. -938 - during his 19-season tenure as coach of the Washington Capitals, Tri-Cities and the Boston Celtics. ''All teams are challenging,'' said Ramsay, in his first season as the Pacer coach. ''There are different levels of expectation for each team. For this team if we make the playoffs we would consider that an accomplishment. For a contending team, merely making the playoffs doesn't achieve that.'' The Pacers have made the playoffs only once (1981) since joining the N.B.A. for the 1976-77 season. SPORTS PEOPLE
