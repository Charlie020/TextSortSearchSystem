Pay Surprise the Experts''  [ Dec. 7 ] : Re: ''Low Increases in L.I. Pay Surprise the Experts''  [ Dec. 7 ] : Long Island is very big on tradition. The Bureau of Labor Statistics should not be surprised that the pay-increase figures for Long Island's clerical and electronic data-processing workers in 1986 were the lowest in 11 years. The fact of the matter is that the majority of clerical and electronic data-processing workers are women, who have traditionally been at the bottom of the wage scale. The fact of the matter is that Long Island is not experiencing a shortage in the labor pool of available clerical and electronic data-processing workers. What Long Island is experiencing is the unwillingness of this female pool of labor to work at low wages, with small salary increases and low expectations of career advancement. Arthur Ringelheim of Laventhol & Horwath, C.P.A.'s, is correct when he said, ''You cannot get good people to stay with you unless you pay good salaries - they will just jump elsewhere, especially in data processing.'' Or in any other profession, for that matter. Working women are working people, and workers will gravitate to the professional areas of employment that offer them the highest expectations of salary and advancement. LORRAINE NEER East Meadow
