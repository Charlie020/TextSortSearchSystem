To the Editor: As a frequent traveler, I have always valued Paul Grimes's advice and information. I've had a few flight-related problems over the years and would like to add to what he had to say in his Dec. 7 column. When there is no alternative to waiting unduly, in an airport or on a plane, there are plenty of distractions to make the delay tolerable. I always have a paperback with me, as well as a few envelopes, addressed and stamped, for friends to whom I have been meaning to write. Besides, it's easy to get into conversation with cosufferers. And I find that just looking around and listening, in any group of strangers, is the most interesting distraction of all. To paraphrase Shakespeare, ''Sweet are the uses of frustration.''
