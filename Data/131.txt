Trump to provide it with additional information before it would allow him to proceed with his purchases of Bally Manufacturing Corporation shares. The Justice Department has asked the real estate developer Donald J. Trump to provide it with additional information before it would allow him to proceed with his purchases of Bally Manufacturing Corporation shares. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Trump said that the Justice Department's antitrust division had requested additional information and documents, ''including information concerning Mr. Trump's present and proposed Atlantic City casino operations.'' Mr. Trump owns two hotel-casinos in Atlantic City. The Chicago-based Bally owns three MGM Grand hotel-casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., Reno and Atlantic City. The request for information would automatically delay the expiration of the waiting period under the antitrust laws for another 20 days from the receipt of the materials by the Justice Department, according to the filing.
