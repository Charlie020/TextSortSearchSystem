THE Vancouver Canucks, languishing in last place in the Smythe Division of the National Hockey League, hope a two-week guest coaching stint by Anatoli Tarasov, the former coach of the Soviet Union's national team, will pay some long range dividends. Tarasov, coach of the powerful Red Army team, will be in Vancouver from Jan. 30-Feb. 14 to assess the Canucks' talents. ''Tarasov has been invited to help us out by watching some of our games and practices,'' said Tom Watt, the Vancouver coach. ''I don't know all the details of his visit as yet, but he may even run one of our workouts during the All-Star break.'' The arrangement with Tarasov is a coaching exchange, with Watt scheduled to go to the Soviet Union in August to work with the Red Army team. SPORTS PEOPLE
