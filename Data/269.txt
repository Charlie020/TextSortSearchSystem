The computers that keep track of this city's medieval tower indicate that it leaned a bit more than usual in 1986, an Italian professor said today. Prof. Giuseppe Toniolo, who heads a group that maintains the landmark, said in his annual report that the 180-foot Tower of Pisa listed an additional five-hundredths of an inch in 1986. The tower, which is more than 800 years old, normally leans an average of four-hundredths of an inch more each year, he said, but the movement appeared to have almost stopped in the 1980's.
