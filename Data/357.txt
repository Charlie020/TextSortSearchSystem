An agreement has been reached between service employees and building owners, averting a strike set for today that threatened to affect the heat, hot water, trash removal and elevator service at more than 1,000 city office buildings, officials said. On Wednesday morning, after an all-night bargaining session, representatives of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations in Manhattan and Local 32B-32J Service Employees International Union reached a new three-year labor agreement, according to Ned Steele, a spokesman for the board. He had no immediate details of the contract. The agreement averted the strike in which thousands of porters, office cleaners, elevator starters, boiler operators and guards were planning to walk out at 12:01 A.M. today. Although the union represents some 65,000 workers, only those in commercial buildings had threatened to strike. No union official was available yesterday for comment. METRO DATELINES
