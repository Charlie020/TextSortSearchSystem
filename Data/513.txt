Crazy Eddie, the chain of electronics stores, has been fined $8,000 for violations of New York City consumer laws, officials said yesterday. At the same time, the company agreed to resolve outstanding consumer complaints and to comply with the law. The Brooklyn-based company had been accused by the City Department of Consumer Affairs of infractions in connection with its ''Blow-Out Blitz'' sales, a continuing series of sales over the past year. The department had alleged that Crazy Eddie's did not always have a reasonable stock of sale items available, ran ads that did not clearly and conspicuously tell consumers when quantities were extremely limited, did not always display advertised prices properly in the stores, sometimes charged more than the regular price for an item while promising ''two for the price of one'' and sometimes failed to disclose limitations on offers.
