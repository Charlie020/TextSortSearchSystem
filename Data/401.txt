A former Chicago Bears quarterback, Vince Evans, has filed a lawsuit contending that Eddie Einhorn and the United States Football League failed to honor financial guarantees made when Evans signed with the now-defunct Chicago Blitz. Evans's lawsuit, for $1.3 million, was filed in United States District Court Wednesday. He seeks the enforcement of an arbitrator's Oct. 1 ruling saying Evans was entitled to the money because the Blitz ownership failed to meet the financial guarantees in his contract after the ball club failed. Evans, who lives in Denver, played for the Bears for seven seasons. In 1983, he was asked by the Blitz to defect from the National Football League. SPORTS PEOPLE
