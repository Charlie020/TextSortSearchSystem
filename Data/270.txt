Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at Palestinian youths who demonstrated today at the Balata refugee center near Nablus on the West Bank, an army spokesman said. The army imposed a curfew on the center after troops broke up the gathering of about 200 youths, who threw large rocks at passing vehicles, the spokesman said. He said two of the youths were arrested. Earlier in the day Palestinians threw rocks at an army patrol in the Nablus business section and smashed the windshield of a van carrying tourists, the spokesman said. He said nobody was injured in the incidents.
