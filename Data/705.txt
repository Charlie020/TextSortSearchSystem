After heated debate over the right of women to hold any office in the Pueblo of Isleta, N.M., voters there elected Verna Williamson to the highest one last week. On becoming the first woman to be elected governor of the pueblo, Ms. Williamson said the voters ''have spoken loud and clear that they want a more open and representative government.'' Ms. Williamson's right to seek election was disputed by Ernest Jaramillo, the former president of the tribal council, who said the pueblo's constitution allowed only men to hold office. The council agreed with Mr. Jaramillo and voided a December primary election won by Ms. Williamson and then tried to cancel last week's balloting. Mr. Jaramillo said he would meet with lawyers to determine the election's legality. HEADLINERS
