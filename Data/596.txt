But 45 percent of the recipients were foreigners, including 13,644 Japanese. Donald J. Quigg, Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, said that an attempt is being made to reverse this trend through the promotion of a school program that teaches students to think analytically. ''The program is spreading very rapidly,'' he added. ''The Japanese have had a similar program since 1946.'' Patents issued in the 1986 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, totaled 76,993, which exceeded the 1985 figure by 1,691. Pendency was reduced by more than a month for most classes of patents. Patent applications reached a record total of 131,403. The 1986 fields of invention included nuclear and solar power, biotechnology, spacecraft, computers, robots, earthquake warnings and toys.
