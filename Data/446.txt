Nine hospitals in southern Florida have now curtailed emergency room service and a tenth has shut down its emergency room as doctors continue to protest malpractice insurance premiums. But less than 24 hours after Dade County opened its Office of Emergency Management to handle large-scale medical emergencies, officials decided the center was not needed. ''There was no onslaught of emergency room closings today, and things have gone very smoothly,'' said Lynn Aspinall, a spokesman for the Metro-Dade Fire Department. Officials had worried that the protest might spread to the nearly 40 hospitals and medical centers in the area. The nine hospitals have limited emergency services to people with head and chest injuries because thoracic and neurological surgeons have refused to work. Hialeah Hospital closed its emergency room Wednesday. Doctors in Florida are facing increases of 25 to 40 percent in their insurance rates. They also oppose a law, which went into effect New Year's Day, that sets minimum amounts for insurance coverage. Florida's 29,600 licensed doctors are now required to carry $250,000 in malpractice insurance for those who treat hospital patients and $100,000 for those who do not, or must inform patients of their decision to do without. The Florida Medical Association estimates neurosurgeons in Dade and Broward counties will pay $143,000 to $176,366 a year for policies that will pay a maximum of $1 million for each claim, up to $3 million a year.
