Barry Jr., pledging to work for statehood for the District of Columbia and for better services for the poor, was sworn in today to a third four-year term as Mayor of Washington. ''Nobody's going to turn us around from educating every person who wants to learn, employing every person who wants to work, housing every person who needs shelter, helping every person who needs new hope,'' he said in his inaugural address on the first day of a four-day celebration whose cost officials have put at $250,000. He pledged to work toward making the district the 51st state, which would give city residents long-sought voting representation in Congress. ''We can never be completely in control of our destiny until we gain statehood for the state of New Columbia,'' he said. The Mayor also defended his administration, which has been hit with many scandals. Mr. Barry, a 50-year-old Democrat who in November handily defeated his opponent, Carol Schwartz, a Republican member of the City Council, is Washington's second elected Mayor since residents gained the power to choose their own government in 1974. The day started with a prayer breakfast, followed by a sparsely attended parade that took marching bands and limousine-riding city officials, but not Mr. Barry, who was late arriving, through a shabby section of downtown that the Mayor has made a target for development.
