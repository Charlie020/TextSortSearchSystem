An article in Business Day on Friday about the Cape Cod Company, a potato chip maker, portrayed it as a fledgling entrepreneurial venture that had begun to expand nationally. The company described itself as a small local business that employed old-fashioned techniques to make an increasingly popular product. But in fact since 1985 Cape Cod has been a division of Eagle Snacks, which is owned by the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the nation's largest brewing concern. The article left a misleading impression by failing to mention the new ownership.
