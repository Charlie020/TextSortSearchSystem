The Governor said, ''We can aim higher.'' In his New Year's Day inauguration address, Governor Cuomo suggested that there was an alternative to the presumably faulty thinking of ''some in Washington.'' The Governor said, ''We can aim higher.'' There were some signs last week that Mr. Cuomo might have decided to aim a bit higher himself. In an interview the day before he was sworn in, he said he would soon begin a series of trips around the country, a disclosure taken by some as a signal that Mr. Cuomo was on the verge of seeking the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination. In the meantime, however, there remained some bread-and-butter issues, such as a matter of milk, to be dealt with at home. A day after the pomp and cannonades that began the Governor's second term, aides announced the resignation of the state Agriculture Commissioner, Joseph Gerace. The aides said he was told that it would be a far better thing for him to go than to stay. The Cuomo administration had been at odds with Mr. Gerace since the Commissioner's decision in December not to allow more milk distributors to operate throughout New York City. The Governor, aiming for lower milk prices through increased competition, had sought to expand the number of dairies with citywide licenses, which are currently held by only five dairies, all in New York State. Mr. Gerace's ruling not to grant a New Jersey dairy a citywide license brought cries of outrage from consumer groups. Daniel Oliver, the Federal Trade Commission chairman, criticized him for favoring ''an anti-consumer monopoly.''  THE REGION
