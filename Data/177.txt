Two employees of a Bronx check-cashing service were found shot to death Tuesday night in their street-level corner store in what the police called an apparent robbery. The victims, employees of the Home Check Cashing Corporation, were found dead inside the locked and shuttered store at 25 West 170th Street, at Inwood Avenue, shortly after 11:30 P.M. Both died of shotgun wounds, the police said. The victims, Valdamar Barrea, 40 years old, and Varghese Ninan, 35, both of Yonkers, were found behind an intact bullet-proof partition, according to the police, who said it was unclear how the intruder got behind the barrier. The police said they believed they were shot at about 6 P.M., the store's usual closing hour. A police spokesman, Officer Peter O'Donnell, said the police had been summoned by a company supervisor who saw the employees' cars parked outside. A safe was found open with only coins in it, the police said, adding that an audit was being performed to see if any cash was taken. METRO DATELINES
