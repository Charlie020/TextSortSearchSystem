237|1987\01\02|For a Little More Truth In Legislative Labeling|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: New York State legislators excel at inventing misleading descriptions of their proposals, but we expect you to call a spade a spade - and not to call a proposed tax measured by the value of automobiles a ''real property tax'' (''Paying for Transit Once a Year,'' Dec. 21). According to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, ''real property'' is ''an estate or property consisting of lands and of all appurtenances to lands, as buildings, crops or mineral rights (distinguished from personal property).'' Autos are in no way ''appurtenances to lands.'' The proposed tax may or may not be good, but it does not help to label it as something familiar to ordinary people and presumably more acceptable than a personal-property tax, which was ended decades ago in New York State.
