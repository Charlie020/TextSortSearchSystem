Two Coast Guard boats rescued 31 passengers early today from a cruise catamaran that ran aground on a reef near Honolulu Harbor, an official said. No injuries were reported. The 21 crew members remained aboard the luxury vessel, the 108-foot Executive Explorer, which hit the reef off Keehi Lagoon at 12:40 A.M., according to a Coast Guard spokesman, assistant duty officer Mark Griggs. The Executive Explorer was traveling at about 20 knots when she slammed into the reef, the spokesman said. The catamaran was in no danger of sinking because she was sitting firmly on the reef, he said, but the impact punched several holes in her hull. The Executive Explorer's fuel tanks were also punctured and leaked diesel fuel.
