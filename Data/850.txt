The winning numbers in last night's $19 million New York Lotto drawing were 3, 9, 14, 22, 27 and 48. To win all or part of the $19 million jackpot, a ticket holder must have all six numbers in one Lotto game. The jackpot was the eighth largest in State Lottery history, according to John Quinn, the lottery director. Mr. Quinn said $15.8 million in $1 bets had been taken in between Thursday morning and last night. He said sales were brisk despite snowstorms that hit much of the state on Friday and the holiday closings of many Lotto outlets. If there is no first-prize winner from last night's drawing, Mr. Quinn said, the jackpot will increase to the mid-$20 million range for the next drawing, which will be Wednesday night.
