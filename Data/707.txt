''The Chinese Government position toward the students is one of toleration,'' a senior education official said last week in discussing the recent wave of pro-democracy demonstrations in China. That attitude was borne out in practice on New Year's Day. Several thousand college students freely converged on Beijing's central Tian An Men Square, the largest such rally in the capital since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1979. The police arrested only a handful, despite a warning that the protesters would be ''severely punished.'' Several were released hours later. Nonetheless, there were growing signs that the conciliatory stance toward the students is eroding. Communist Party hard-liners, whose names usually appear only in connection with minor Government matters, were quoted in the press as saying that the calls for freedom are an unhealthy attempt to impose ''all-out Westernization.'' Taiwan was accused of mobilizing ''secret agents'' to incite the students. Some Western diplomats said that the conservatives might use the upheaval to muster resistance to the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader. But others speculated that Mr. Deng might welcome the reaction as a way to keep the rapid pace of change under control. THE WORLD
