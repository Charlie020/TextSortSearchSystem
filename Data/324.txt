A man with a semiautomatic rifle fired through the doors of a lounge filled with New Year's Eve revelers, killing a woman and wounding five people, three critically, the police said today. The police said the shootings at the Hub Lounge here might have led to more deaths if a quick-thinking manager had not shut the doors after he saw the gunman go to his pickup truck and get the rifle. Cody Williams, a 43-year-old resident of Homer, was arrested about a mile from the lounge and was being held without bond on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kim Addison, 26, the police said. The authorities said Mr. Williams had gone to the lounge earlier in the evening and quarreled with a woman described as a former companion who worked there. The woman, who was not identified by the police, was said to be uninjured. The police said the man was later stopped from entering by employees who reported that he was carrying a pistol. He left the bar, then came back minutes later with a .233-caliber rifle and shot through the front doors, Officer John Bacot said.
