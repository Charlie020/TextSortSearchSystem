Now, the United States has joined the list, and a ''hypermarket'' is coming to Brookhaven Township, L.I. It originated in France, then spread through Europe and South America. Now, the United States has joined the list, and a ''hypermarket'' is coming to Brookhaven Township, L.I. The 330,000-square-foot store - the equivalent of four football fields - will be 900 feet across, with no interior walls. It will have 86 checkout counters and will ''sell everything except a car and a boat,'' according to the architect, Michael Spector of the Spector Group in North Hills, L.I. The store is being developed by Carrefour U.S.A. of Secaucus, N.J., a subsidiary of Carrefour, the Paris-based developer that originated the hypermarket concept. The one-story steel structure - painted light-blue, gray and red - will adjoin a 400,000-square-foot shopping plaza to be built by Western Development Corporation of Washington. The entire complex, called Stony Brook Mills, will occupy 69 acres on Nicolls Road. Completion of the market is expected in November; the plaza should open in late 1988.
