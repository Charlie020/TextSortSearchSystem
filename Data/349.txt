None of the big-capitalization blue chips that surged ahead and grabbed the headlines - issues such as Merck, Eastman Kodak and General In a year that saw equity market indexes set record highs, the common stocks that showed the best percentage gains on the New York Stock Exchange had little in common. None of the big-capitalization blue chips that surged ahead and grabbed the headlines - issues such as Merck, Eastman Kodak and General Electric -were among the top performers. Instead, the roster of best-performing issues included a retailer of consumer electronics, a mining company, a mutual fund management company and an equipment supplier to Sears, Roebuck. Specialty retailers also fared handsomely. Issues posting the largest percentage losses had more in common. A number of losers were companies in various facets of the recession-ridden energy industry. Others, such as the GCA Corporation and Floating Point Systems, were technology companies affected by the decline in capital spending. The Service Resources Corporation, the top performer of 1986 with a gain of 235.1 percent, had a dramatic turnabout. A year earlier, when it was known as the Norlin Corporation, the company ranked as the Big Board's second-biggest loser, with a decline of 74.1 percent. The company, whose basic business is to provide office support services to law firms and investment banking firms, has operated at a deficit since 1980, but lately its financial position has improved. Spanish Bank Does Well The American Depository Receipts of Banco Central, Spain's largest bank, rose $23.75, or 226.2 percent, to $34.25, to rank as the exchange's second-best performer. This reflected an improving economy in the bank's service areas. Placing third with an increase of 220 percent was the Patten Corporation, which moved to the Big Board from the over-the-counter market in October. Patten, which subdivides undeveloped rural properties for sale to individuals, has reported sharply rising profits. Winners with the most familiar names were retailers. Reebok International, for example, which sells athletics footware, gained 152.7 percent. It also came to the exchange from the over-the-counter market. New Tack at The Gap The Gap, a specialty apparel retailer, benefited from a new merchandising strategy that rejuvenated profits and sent the shares ahead $20.25, to $35.75, a gain of 130.6 percent. It also appeared on the 1985 list of winners. The average gain for a Big Board stock was 13.98 percent, with virtually all of the advance occurring in the opening quarter. The exchange's composite index closed the year at 138.58, after reaching a record high of 145.75 on Sept. 4. As uncertainty over the economy grew throughout the year, many of the big, blue-chip stocks outperformed the rest of the market, with the Dow Jones industrial average posting a 22.6 percent gain for the year. It set a high of 1,955.57 on Dec. 2. Turnover for the exchange, swelled by program trading, reached 35.68 billion shares, topping record set in 1985 by 29.7 percent. The First City Bancorporation of Texas, whose shares plummeted $9.50, to $3.375, showed the largest percentage loss, 73.8 percent. The company omitted its dividend in November and is expected to report a large loss for 1986. Like many other Texas banks, First City has suffered from a recession in real estate as well as in the energy industry. Its decline was only slightly larger than the GCA Corporation's drop of 73.3 percent. GCA, which makes semiconductor production equipment, also appeared on the 1985 list of losers. One percentage gainer provided something of a mystery. L. E. Myers, a utility construction contractor, has shown heavy losses in recent years. But its shares rose 126.3 percent in 1986. Elliott Robbins, a senior vice president, said Wednesday that the recent price increase apparently reflected a new investor with a 6.6 percent stock ownership in Myers. He identified the investor as Leonard Chavin, a Chicago real estate developer. ''He has not indicated any plans so far to us,'' Mr. Robbins said.  MOST ACTIVE N.Y.S.E.
