Leon Wieseltier writes perceptively about how the White House style combines ''pure hearts and dirty hands.'' He then justifies the worst of President Reagan's dirty-handed actions, sponsorship of the Nicaraguan contras. Americas Watch (a nonpartisan human-rights organization, affiliated with Helsinki Watch, which has been active in monitoring Soviet human-rights violations) concluded in its 1985-86 report on Nicaragua that the contras routinely use terrorism to prevent civilians from cooperating with the Sandinista Government. The report said that the contras ''not only murdered their victims; they also tortured and mutilated them.'' Mr. Wieseltier thinks the President's support of the contras is sound. It is the financing of the contras with Iranian cash, not the contra terrorist program, that he associates with dirty hands. He finds fault with the form and approves the substance. But Ronald Reagan's form is his substance.  EDGAR VILLCHUR  Woodstock, N.Y.
