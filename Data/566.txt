Finance Minister Chu Okongwu said today that the 1987 budget, about 90 percent of which is supported by crude oil sales, was based on a world price for oil of $13 a barrel to prevent a repetition of the shocks caused by the collapse of prices in 1986.|Nigeria, hard hit by last year's sharp decline in crude oil prices, is conservatively basing its 1987 budget on oil valued at $13 a barrel - some $5 less than the current world price.
