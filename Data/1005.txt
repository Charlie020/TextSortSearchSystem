FAMILY TREASON: The Walker Spy Case. By Jack Kneece. (Stein & Day, $17.95.) This is the first of what is expected to be a rash of books on the Walker family spy ring. John Walker Jr., the Navy veteran turned spymaster who supposedly lured his brother and son into espionage, at one time asked $5 million to tell his treasonous tale. Jack Kneece, a former reporter with The Associated Press, beat the Walkers to the bookstores with a readable book written in the simple, no-nonsense style of a wire service reporter. The problem: most wire service stories would be better organized than this. Details of the precious Navy secrets compromised by the Walkers are not really explored until the final few pages. And given the fact that Mr. Walker's espionage operation is sometimes described as the most damaging Soviet spy ring in history, that seems an unforgivable flaw. Although Mr. Kneece has turned up some interesting anecdotes about Mr. Walker's Navy career, there is little new in the author's reporting. In fact, he seems to have relied heavily on court records and the work of other journalists, whom he freely credits. And the speed with which the book was written has left it incomplete. A serious reader should be advised to wait; a better book on the Walker case is doubtless on its way.
