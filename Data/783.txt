It is a problem that let a superbly qualified President - Lyndon B. Johnson -give us Vietnam. President Reagan only proves that an unqualified President who is presumably imbued with the proper spirit fares little better.|Leon Wieseltier's analysis of ''What Went Wrong'' is a solid piece of work on the defects in our ideology, but the problem with our Presidency is as much systemic as ideological.

President Reagan only proves that an unqualified President who is presumably imbued with the proper spirit fares little better. So long as the Presidency is in the hands of a single powerful man, he will inevitably be surrounded by people who tell him only what he wants to hear. Thus does today's policy error become tomorrow's unquestionable premise. Thus do the President's flaws become, not countered, but magnified.  WILLIAM A. AKER  New York City
