Vinnie Johnson scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter tonight, lifting the Detroit Pistons to their fourth straight victory, a 129-128 triumph over the Nets. Detroit has won 15 of its last 18 games. New Jersey, which had won its previous two games, fell to 8-21, the worst record in the Eastern Conference. Two jump shots by Johnson and a basket by Isiah Thomas gave Detroit, which led by 11 points on several occasions, a 123-120 lead with 1 minute 3 seconds left. A 12-foot jumper by Johnson 15 seconds later gave the Pistons a 125-122 lead. Bill Laimbeer stole a pass from Kevin McKenna with 27 seconds left. Thomas then made a field goal and Joe Dumars added two free throws to end the Nets' hopes, despite 3-point field goals by Leon Wood and McKenna in the final 12 seconds. Adrian Dantley scored 23 points for Detroit, Laimbeer scored 21 and Sidney Green added 18. Orlando Woolridge led the Nets with 29 points, while Buck Williams added 20. Dennis Rodman, a rookie, scored the final two field goals of the first half, the second on a driving layup after stealing the ball from Mike Gminski. Detroit led by 65-54 at halftime. Rick Mahorn, a reserve forward for Detroit, did not dress for the game because of a bruised tailbone. A team spokesman said Mahorn is doubtful for the game Saturday night at Chicago. Johnson, a reserve guard, was 7 of 7 from the field in the fourth quarter. ''What goes through my mind when you're shooting like that is, 'Hey, I'm going to hit the next one,' '' Johnson said. ''You feel like you can't miss in that situation,'' he said. ''We've got two great point guards in Joe and Isiah. Guys are setting picks for you. You've got the open shot. You just nail it.'' Woolridge said the Nets simply ran out of time. ''It's just a pity we didn't have another minute on the clock,'' said Woolridge, who fell 2 points short of his season high. ''We know they're a running team,'' Woolridge said. ''We didn't want to run at their tempo; we wanted to run at our tempo. They set the tempo early. We weren't in our rhythm early in the game.''
