An arms dealer, free on bail while awaiting trial on charges related to illegal arms exports, has been jailed in New York for violating the terms of his bail, a prosecutor said Friday. The prosecutor said the defendant, Solomon Schwartz, 51 years old, had been plotting to sell military parts to Iran and had done unauthorized travel. He was ordered jailed until the start of his trial, set for Feb. 17, by Judge Thomas C. Platt of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Mr. Schwartz, of Monsey, N.Y., was arrested Wednesday at La Guardia Airport as he left a plane from Houston, according to the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn. Mr. Schwartz is an owner of Texas Armament Advisers of Brownsville, Tex. An affidavit by an Assistant United States Attorney in Brooklyn, David V. Kirby, said Mr. Schwartz was in Israel from Sept. 28 to Oct. 2. His bail requires that he stay in the New York area. Mr. Schwartz and three others are scheduled to stand trial next month on charges of plotting to ship military equipment to the Soviet Union, Poland, Iraq and Argentina. Only one deal, involving night-vision devices for Argentina during the Falkland war in 1982, was carried out, Mr. Kirby said. Mr. Schwartz had been free on bail since 1984, when the original charges were filed. All have pleaded not guilty. Mr. Kirby said that according to information obtained from the United States Customs Service, Mr. Schwartz had been involved since September in a plot to sell parts of F-4 fighter and C-130 cargo planes to Iran.
