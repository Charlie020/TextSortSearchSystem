996|1987\01\04|Threats to Mexico|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: I was shocked by Alan Riding's categorical remark, in his review of Sol W. Sanders' ''Mexico'' (Dec. 7), that ''Mexico currently faces no threat from Guatemala (or indeed from Nicaragua, Cuba or the Soviet Union).'' Those of us who warned that, after independence, India would align itself with the Soviet Union were ridiculed. Then we were told that China would not go Communist because of its family structure. Then that Cuba would not go Communist because of the Cubans' love of freedom. Then that Nicaragua would not be a Soviet target because the Soviet Union would not want to take on another Latin American country because of the cost of Cuba. As one buried in the analysis of Soviet sources, I see clearly the likelihood that the Sandinistas will remain in control of Nicaragua, and then will come El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and finally Mexico. I do not say this will happen, but it is a possibility that cannot be brushed aside.  RONALD HILTON  Stanford, Calif.
