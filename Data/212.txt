When the new Senate convenes next Tuesday in the opening session of the 100th Congress, the body will be under the control of the Democrats and, as a result, will have a new parliamentarian. The current parliamentarian, Robert B. Dove, is something of a fixture in the Senate after 20 years' service, first as an assistant and then as chief parliamentarian since 1981. But he was drawn into a contretemps with the Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd, then in the minority, a few months ago on a complex procedural question after a cloture vote. The matter took a day and a half to resolve; by the time it was over, a ruling based on Mr. Dove's interpretation of procedure was overturned by an overwhelming 92-to-5 vote on the floor. Mr. Byrd, himself a master parliamentarian, is now the majority leader, and Mr. Dove is out of a job. Mr. Dove will be succeeded by Alan S. Frumin, now an assistant parliamentarian, who will officially assume his new duties Tuesday. Senator Byrd himself declined to discuss the reasons behind the change, but did take time in a telephone interview to bat down a rumor he was also planning to replace the Senate chaplain, Richard Halverson. ''I've never thought of firing the chaplain,'' the Senator said. ''In my view, the Lord's work is a little above partisan politics.''  WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
