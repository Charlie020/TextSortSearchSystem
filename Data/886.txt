Prosecutors last week won the largest criminal fine ever levied for Federal environmental violations when a New Bedford, Mass., manufacturer pleaded guilty to dumping heavy metals in the city sewers. The USM Corporation was fined $1,025,000 by Judge Walter S. Skinner of Federal District Court in Boston. If the company completes a waste-water treatment system at its plant by October, the judge said, $225,000 of the fine will be suspended. USM's parent company, the Emhart Corporation of Farmington, Conn., said it took ''full responsibility'' for failure to comply with Clean Water Act standards at the J. C. Rhodes plant. But it maintained, as it did when the 41-count indictment was handed up in November, that delays in cutting the discharge of untreated waste water were largely beyond its control. The waste water, from electroplating and metal finishing, contained copper, nickel and zinc. The metals cannot be filtered by the municipal sewage treatment facility, which discharges into New Bedford's harbor. IDEAS & TRENDS
