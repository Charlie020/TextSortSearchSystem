The millions of Americans who paid professionals to prepare their 1985 Federal income tax return are not being mailed the reporting forms and instructions for 1986 income that other taxpayers are currently receiving. In an effort to save money, the Internal Revenue Service is sending all those who hired preparers last year cards affixed with pre-addressed mailing labels; the taxpayers are asked to give the labels to their agents, who presumably have generous supplies of forms already. These taxpayers are also getting an order blank for a full tax package in case they want to return to the do-it-yourself system. WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
