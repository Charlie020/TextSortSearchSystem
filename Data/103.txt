President Augusto Pinochet said today that a state of siege, imposed hours after an attempt on his life in September, would not be renewed when it expired early next month. He also announced a virtual end to the system of exile under which thousands of political opponents have been banned from returning to the country. General Pinochet said the state of siege, now in force only in Santiago after being lifted in other parts of the country, had served its purpose. In the text of his speech, issued to the press before his year-end address tonight, the President gave no figures for the number of exiles who would be allowed to return. According to human rights officials, about 3,500 Chileans are barred from entering the country. General Pinochet said that over the next 90 days the Government would reduce the list until only those who were considered a ''serious risk'' to the country would be included. The state of siege was declared after left-wing guerrillas ambushed the presidential motorcade outside Santiago, killing five of General Pinochet's bodyguards. Despite the lifting of the state of siege, the military Government will still hold wide powers to arrest and to restrict freedom of information, movement and assembly under a state of emergency that has been in force, apart from a brief period in 1983, since the 1973 military coup.
