Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a political force to be reckoned with in her own right, is thought in some quarters to be considering resigning her Cabinet post to join her husband, Bob, the Republican leader in the Senate, in his expected quest for his party's Presidential nomination. Some staff members noted not long ago that Mrs. Dole's appointment calendar was booked through the fall, so any such move was not likely to be imminent. But now, Dole-watchers note that she has a number of vacancies on her Transportation Department staff, which is sometimes a hint in Washington a change at the top might be in the making. The department's general counsel, Jim J. Marquez, departed at the end of the year, as did Jennifer A. Hillings, the assistant secretary for public affairs, and Ownie Smolko, the deputy assistant secretary for public affairs. Three other public affairs posts are also vacant. WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
