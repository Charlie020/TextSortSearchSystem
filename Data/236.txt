236|1987\01\02|Rap, Gab and Schmooze Like a Native|To the Editor:|To the Editor: To the Editor: A reader commenting on foreign-language study in the United States (letter, Dec. 19) said that the French that Americans are taught in school won't help them ask for directions on the Paris subway, the Metro. Of course not! Would a Frenchman's knowledge of Shakespeare be of any assistance in New York's subways? Anyone trying to get around in a foreign country needs a working knowledge of conversation and more conversation, not the classics. To order from a menu, one has to converse with the waiter; to find the best way to the Louvre, one converses with a passerby. The same applies when shopping where English is not spoken. I have an infallible, convenient and cheap way to brush up on my French, German or Spanish. I read detective stories. Any good whodunit is replete with conversation and enriched by contemporary idioms and slang that I can incorporate into my own vocabulary. Two pages of Georges Simenon or a French translation of a Perry Mason will reward the reader with more spoken French than a novel by Victor Hugo. Such an exercise can warm up even a knowledge of French that is only fairly adequate. A final warning. Do not waste your time reading foreign newspapers. Their French is not the language people use while strolling down the Rue de Rivoli. ADOLF C. ROBISON  Teaneck, N.J., Dec. 21, 1986
