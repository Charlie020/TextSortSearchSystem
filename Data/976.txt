To the Editor: Your article on risotto (Travel, Nov. 30) brought back wonderful memories of remarkable meals throughout Italy. Since I teach American law students in Rome each summer, I have had the opportunity to sample a large number of the varieties of risotto available throughout Italy, and I look forward to trying some of the specialties recommended in the article. You omitted one of the most delectable of the risotto dishes: risotto alla sciampagna (risotto in champagne sauce), one of the many specialties available at Il Bagatto, on the Via Trionfale in Rome. This restaurant is on Monte Mario, near the Cavalieri Hilton Hotel, on an open-air terrace with a panoramic view of Rome. The restaurant, by the way, also serves a wonderful risotto alla crema di scampi (risotto with a creamed shrimp sauce).  THOMAS M.
