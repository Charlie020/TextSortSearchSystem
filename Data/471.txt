471|1987\01\03|CONGRESS REPORT SEES BUDGET CAP OF $174.5|The Congressional Budget Office said today that the Government would run deficits of $174.5 billion this year and $169.2 billion next year if Congress took no action to change current law.|The Congressional Budget Office said today that the Government would run deficits of $174.5 billion this year and $169.2 billion next year if Congress took no action to change current law. The Congressional Budget Office said today that the Government would run deficits of $174.5 billion this year and $169.2 billion next year if Congress took no action to change current law. The estimates may surprise some members of Congress, who adjourned in October saying they had reduced the deficit for the current fiscal year to $151 billion. That is $7 billion beyond the target for the year sought by the budget-balancing law enacted a year ago. Rudolph G. Penner, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the new estimates were based on revised economic assumptions and new data on tax collections and Government spending patterns, including the effects of legislation passed in September and October. Reagan Budget More Optimistic In a letter today to the chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees, Mr. Penner also presented his economic forecast, predicting that the economy would expand about 3 percent a year in 1987 and 1988. President Reagan's budget, to be sent to Congress Monday, makes more optimistic economic assumptions: growth of 3.2 percent this year and 3.7 percent in 1988. Last year at this time the Administration was saying the economy would expand at an annual rate of 4 percent in 1987 and 1988. The Congressional estimate for the deficit this fiscal year is close to the Administration estimate of $173.2 billion. Deficit's Relation to Output The Congressional Budget Office said that under current law the deficit would decline steadily, to $84.8 billion in the fiscal year 1992. It projected deficits of $162.2 billion in 1989, $133.8 billion in 1990 and $109.2 billion in 1991. The office assumes that the economy will continue growing in this period, so it predicts the deficit will shrink from 4 percent of the value of all goods and services the country produces this year to 1.4 percent of this gross national product in 1992 if current law is not changed. In his letter, Mr. Penner said the new estimates of Government spending ''increase the projected deficits substantially'' beyond the levels anticipated just a few months ago. Aid to Banks and Farmers One factor, he said, is that Federal agencies will be providing more aid to troubled financial institutions. Spending for this purpose by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation is estimated to total $6 billion this year, or $4.2 billion more than the budget office assumed in August. In addition, Mr. Penner said the grim outlook for American agricultural exports was expected to ''increase outlays for farm price supports by $3 billion in 1987 and about $6 billion per year in the 1988-1991 period,'' beyond previous estimates. Spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor, ''exceeded expectations'' in 1986, and ''this growth is expected to continue,'' he said in the letter. Military Growth Is Outpaced Aides to Republican members of Congress observed that military spending was growing more slowly than the budget as a whole, according to the new projections. The report by the Congressional Budget Office shows that under current law total spending would grow 6 percent, to $1,069.4 billion in the fiscal year 1988, which starts Oct. 1, while military outlays would grow 3.7 percent, to $289.9 billion. By contrast, according to the report, spending on Government benefit programs would increase 6.4 percent, to $512 billion in 1988 under current law. Other nonmilitary spending would increase 11.4 percent, to $185.4 billion in 1988 under current law, the office said. This category of spending includes Federal law enforcement, transportation programs, foreign aid, job training and the work of dozens of other Government agencies from the National Weather Service to the National Park Service. The report indicates that benefit programs are growing faster than the budget office anticipated in August. It now estimates that these programs, which account for nearly half the entire budget, will cost the Government $481 billion this year, or $14 billion more than it projected in August. 'One-Time Savings' Cited Under current law, it said, the Government would spend $617 billion on benefit programs in 1991, or $24 billion more than it projected five months ago. Just before Congress adjourned in October, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and other Republicans said it appeared that the 1987 deficit would be $151 billion. But the ranking Democrat on the panel, Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida, said then that the deficit would be substantially higher ''when you strip out the smoke and mirrors.'' The Congressional Budget Office said today that legislation approved in the final months of the last Congress would reduce the deficit by $32 billion in the current fiscal year. However, it said most of these changes produced ''one-time savings'' and would reduce the deficit by only $6 billion a year in the future. Mr. Reagan's budget will show a deficit of $107.8 billion for 1988. If Congress made no changes in existing law, the 1988 deficit would be $150 billion, according to Administration estimates shown in confidential budget documents. This is $19 billion less than the deficit projected by the Congressional Budget Office. Differing Economic Assumptions Edwin L. Dale Jr., spokesman for the Administration's Office of Management and Budget, said the difference was ''almost entirely accounted for'' by different assumptions about the performance of the economy and the timing of Federal payments to farmers. The Administration assumes lower interest rates than the Congressional Budget Office for this year and the next five years. For 1987, the Congressional office envisions rates of 5.6 percent on three-month Treasury bills and 7.2 percent on 10-year Government bonds. By contrast, the Administration assumes those rates will be 5.4 percent and 6.7 percent.
